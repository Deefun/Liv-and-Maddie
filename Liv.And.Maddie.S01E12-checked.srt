1
00:00:04,871 --> 00:00:06,672
准备好了没  老爸
Almost ready, dad?

2
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,973
我们得赶紧开始训练了
We got to get a little practice in.

3
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:10,242
我在系鞋带
Just lacing up.

4
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:12,678
老爸  故意拖延比赛
Delay of game on dad!

5
00:00:13,646 --> 00:00:15,647
听着  帕克  如果你要做我们的裁判
Okay, Parker, if you want to be our ref,

6
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,282
你至少要等到比赛开始吧
at least wait until we start playing.

7
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,651
顶撞裁判
Talking back to the ref,

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,186
技术犯规
technical foul!

9
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,526
你这穿的是什么东西
What are those?

10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:34,066
超短裤
Those are shorts.

11
00:00:34,068 --> 00:00:38,103
这种裤子代表了服饰史上的一段黑暗时期
It was a dark time in fashion before you were born.

12
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:41,106
这是皮特·鲁尼在职业巅峰时候的好运裤
These are prime-time Pete Rooney's lucky shorts.

13
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:45,210
当年的州冠军  现在重返江湖
to the state championship, so he's wearing them now.

14
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,280
当皮特·鲁尼直呼自己的名字
And when he talks about himself in the third person,

15
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:53,819
他就已经准备好重振雄风
it means prime-time Pete Rooney's fixing to win.

16
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,188
最近城里有一场老少配
Our town has a big two-on-two tournament

17
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,656
二对二篮球联赛
where an adult teams up with a kid

18
00:00:57,658 --> 00:01:00,626
呵呵  这比赛从来就没有女孩赢过
and, uh, ha, no girl's ever won...

19
00:01:00,628 --> 00:01:03,629
直到现在
Till now.

20
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:05,764
我的意思是我会是第一位在这场比赛摘得桂冠的女孩
I was saying that I'm gonna be the first girl to win.

21
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,000
是不是我不说  哈  怎样  就不清楚来着  哦  好吧
Was that not clear without the "bam, what?" Yeah, okay.

22
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:09,802
哈  怎样
Bam! What?!

23
00:01:09,804 --> 00:01:11,036
好吧  老爸
Okay, dad.

24
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:12,638
我见过你在球场边运筹帷幄指点江山
I've seen you holding a clipboard on the court.

25
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,873
现在看看你还能不能打球
Now let's see if you can still play.

26
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,077
哦  我的球技可没退化
Oh, I can still play.

27
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,179
看好了  怎样
Check it. What?

29
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,693
球技还是有点退化了
Just a little rusty.

30
00:01:34,695 --> 00:01:37,062
走步
Traveling!

31
00:01:37,064 --> 00:01:38,931
- 走步  - 对的
- Traveling? - Yeah.

32
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,166
你的超短裤走得你的屁股都晒太阳了
Those tiny shorts are traveling right up your butt.

35
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,306
最好的朋友
Better in stereo

36
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:49,274
不同的朋友
b... b... better in stereo

37
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,343
迎着清晨阳光
- I'm up with the sunshine - let's go

38
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,712
穿上舒服衣裳
- I lace up my high tops - oh no

39
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,347
扣篮  热热身
- slam dunk - ready or not

40
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:57,683
秀出你的份量
yeah, show me what you got

41
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,718
站在舞台中央
- I'm under the spotlight - holler

42
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,787
准备下一场较量
I dare you, come on and follow

43
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,756
你有你的节拍
you dance to your own beat

44
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:06,391
我的歌声嘹亮
I'll sing the melody

45
00:02:06,393 --> 00:02:08,760
你想接受
when you say yea-ah-ah

46
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:10,162
我却摇头
I say no-oh-oh

47
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:11,730
你想停留
when you say stop

48
00:02:12,899 --> 00:02:15,267
我却一心只想  走走走
all I want to do is go, go, go

49
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:18,270
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the other half of me, me

50
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,906
学不来的朋友
the half I'll never be-e

51
00:02:20,908 --> 00:02:24,109
截然不同的朋友
the half that drives me crazy

52
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:26,778
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the better half of me, me

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,747
离不开的朋友
the half I'll always need

54
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,116
你我有
but we both know

55
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:33,685
不或缺的朋友
we're better in stereo.

56
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,123
呼
Whew.

57
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,958
这绝不简单
This is tough.

58
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,796
我却偏偏运动天赋不佳
but I am not particularly gifted in the sports department.

59
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,366
就你这样子  一看就知道你几斤几两了
Trust me. It looks like it.
（此人由 NBA 火箭队中锋德怀特·霍华德扮演）

60
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:51,103
我有把这个球
Oh, I am dying

61
00:02:51,105 --> 00:02:53,071
从你身下踢走的欲望
to kick that ball out from under you.

62
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:55,407
不过看来你给
But you seem

63
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,889
自己找了个保镖嘛
to have gotten yourself a bodyguard.

64
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,979
帕克  这是伯纳德
Parker, this is Bernard.

65
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:04,016
商场抽奖  房车一辆
I entered a raffle at the mall to win a personal trailer.

66
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,718
没想到一字之差  成了运动教练
Turns out it was for a personal trainer...

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,721
而我偏偏不需要这个
Which I do not need.

68
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:13,392
乔伊  你这缺乏运动都明摆着了  还整房车继续拒绝运动
Joey, you need a trainer much more than you need a trailer.

69
00:03:13,394 --> 00:03:17,162
大个子兄弟  我不这么认为
I respectfully disagree, tree top.

70
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,265
房车就像是装了轮子的洗手间
A trailer's like a bathroom on wheels.

71
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,467
只有想不到没有做不到啊
The possibilities are endless.

72
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:25,871
私人教练可以为你在健身和营养方面指点迷津
A trainer can give you tips on fitness and nutrition,

73
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:28,373
还能让你的生活更快乐
but also make your lives happier...

74
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,309
更健康
And healthier.

75
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:32,010
我已经很快乐了
I'm already happy

76
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:34,846
而且也比较健康
and healthy-ish.

77
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:36,848
乔伊  在你这么大的时候
Joey, when I was your age,

78
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,483
我也不喜欢运动
I hated to work out too.

79
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,186
女孩们肆意嘲笑伯纳德 1.0
The ladies laughed at Bernard 1.0.

81
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:51,363
不过现在女士们可就喜欢伯纳德 2.0 得多
But the ladies love Bernard 2.0 much more.

83
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:57,970
我想要妹子们喜欢我
Oh, I want the ladies to love me...

84
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:00,038
至少知道我的存在
Or at least know that I'm alive.

85
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,875
我就是一块
I am a pathetic

86
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,377
空白的材料
lump of Clay.

87
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,912
您开始吧
Mold me.

89
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,285
嘿  丽芙
Oh, hey, Liv.

90
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,354
哦  你坐在这里看书啊
Oh, sitting and reading.

91
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:19,391
我还记得当年我有空就坐下来看书呢
I remember when I used to have time for that.

92
00:04:19,393 --> 00:04:21,960
对哦  这是戏剧社要排演的节目
Yeah, it's a play that the drama club is doing.

93
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,962
他们请我演主角
And they offered me the lead.

94
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:25,197
不错
Fun.

95
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,866
你在《放声高歌》之后的舞台首秀
Your first role since sing it loud.

96
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:33,405
嗯  请你别再这样了
Yeah, please don't ever do that again.

97
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,109
这个节目是关于一个母亲
It's a story about a working mother

98
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,945
试图平衡她的事业  家庭和孩子
who struggles to juggle her career, home, and kids.

100
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,315
我真不知道我能不能胜任
I'm just really not sure that I can pull it off.

101
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:46,818
我天天都这么想
I have that same thought every day of my life.

102
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,322
不过  这个角色是不是真的有必要
But, like, do we really want to play a character who is

103
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:53,825
这么辛劳  以至于
so overworked and haggard

104
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:57,229
只能勉强苟且度日
that she can barely make it through her day?

105
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,399
- 这听上去很辛苦啊  - 是啊
- Wow, that does sound terrible. - Yeah.

106
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,134
剧情里面是不是还有一个
Well, is there another character in the play

107
00:05:02,136 --> 00:05:03,602
单身无后的角色
who's single and doesn't have kids?

108
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,971
- 就她姐姐  - 你就演她吧
- Actually, her sister. - Play her.

109
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,242
嘿  玛蒂
Hey, madds.

110
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:11,943
你和老爸排练的怎样
Rehearsal any better with dad today?

111
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:14,379
首先  这叫训练
Okay, one, it's called practice.

112
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,116
然后  排练整个就一团糟
Two, rehearsal was a disaster.

113
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:20,986
他跑不动  投篮投不进
He's running slower. He's shooting worse.

114
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:23,422
然后他的短裤比以往更短了
And somehow his shorts got even shorter.

115
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:26,391
这是不是意味着你成不了
Does this mean that you aren't gonna be

116
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:29,227
赢得选美  比赛的第一个女孩
the first girl to win the pageant... tournament?

117
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:31,163
这话才出口我就知道我错了
I knew it was wrong the second I said it.

118
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:34,900
跟老爸组队的话我肯定赢不了
Well, I'm certainly not gonna win with dad on my team.

119
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:36,401
那我怎么办
What do I do?

120
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,337
这样吧  我以前曾经
Okay. Here is an exercise

121
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,538
这么解决这种问题
that I've done in the past.

122
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,907
闭上眼睛  开始全神贯注
Close your eyes and let's visualize

123
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,544
冥想这个问题的最佳解决方案
the best possible solution to your problem.

126
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,963
丽芙  玛蒂
Liv, Maddie,

127
00:06:04,965 --> 00:06:06,631
这位是伯纳德  我的私人教练
this is Bernard, my personal trainer.

128
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,934
他会帮我变“厉害”
He's gonna get me all jacked!
（jacked：受药物影响的）

129
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,939
他说是把我练成肌肉男
Which he says means muscular.

130
00:06:13,941 --> 00:06:15,140
幸会幸会
Nice to meet you.

131
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,875
你家的垃圾筒在哪里
Um, where is the trash?

134
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:29,187
谢谢夸奖  我当年大学里打过一段时间的篮球
Thank you. I played a little college ball back in the day.

135
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,925
嘿  乔伊  健身房在那里
But come on, Joey. The gym is that way.

136
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:39,030
我得把你练得更“壮”
I got to get you ripped.
（ripped：受药物影响的）

137
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:42,567
“壮”那也是让我变的肌肉发达
"Ripped," that also means muscular.

138
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:46,371
呵呵  冥想从来没有
Okay, the visualization thing

139
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,940
这么有效过
has never  worked that well before.

140
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,377
看来这是要让我把老爸踢走的架势
So that was the universe telling me to dump dad, right?

141
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,480
这不摆明了你应该把老爸踹了么
The universe is screaming at you to dump dad.

142
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,681
既然都这样了
Let's ride this wave.

143
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,217
好吧  我们再闭上眼睛
Okay, now close your eyes with me

144
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:03,188
一起冥想莱恩·戈斯林
and let's visualize Ryan gosling.

145
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:09,027
- 你好啊  队友  - 你好啊  教练
- Hey, teammate. - Hey, coach.

146
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:10,462
关于这次联赛  我想和你谈谈
I need to talk to you about the tournament.

147
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,431
不错  我正好也在练习步法
Great. I've been working on my jumper,

148
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,565
把比赛的节奏找回来了
getting my rhythm back.

149
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,668
什么  哦
What? Oh.

150
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,237
嗯  老爸  嗯
Yeah, so, dad, um...

151
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,274
我们两个打球真的不错
You and I have had some really great times together.

152
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:26,511
不过我不觉得我们能有什么结果
I just don't think that it's gonna work out.

153
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,947
你的意思是
What are you saying?

154
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,583
我得跟你掰了
I'm breaking up with you.

155
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:33,718
啥
What?

156
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,621
为什么  我做了什么了  我能改的
Why? What did I do? I can change.

157
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,324
我能变得更好的啊
I can be better.

158
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,626
听着  问题不在于你  而在于我
See, it's not you, it's me.

159
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:44,529
我是你爸
But I'm your dad.

160
00:07:44,531 --> 00:07:47,732
放心  在我心中你始终会有
Right, and I will always have a...

161
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:50,469
特别的一块地方的
Special place in my heart for you,

162
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,472
不过现在是时候我该找别人了
but it's just time that I move on.

163
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,508
我认为长远看来  这样对我们两个都有好处
I think in the long run, this is gonna be better for both of us.

164
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:00,679
哇  哇  意想不到
Wow. Wow. I can't believe this.

165
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:05,116
我觉得我们两个应该在一起的的
I thought we were good together, you and me.

166
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:08,253
尴尬哟
This is awkward.

167
00:08:08,255 --> 00:08:09,454
老爸  我希望和别人一起
Dad, there's someone else.

169
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:16,094
你没事吧
Are you okay?

170
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,530
我没事  你懂的
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine, you know.

171
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,032
只是有点吃惊  不过我没事
Just a little surprised, but it's cool, you know.

172
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:25,403
你转向左  我面向右
You do you. I'll do me.

173
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:28,206
我回家还是跟老妈走吧
Maybe I'll just get a ride home with mom.

174
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:29,407
我觉得这样对我们两个都好
I think that would be best.

175
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,447
多谢你愿意
Thank you so much

176
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,648
加入我的队伍  伯纳德
for agreeing to be on my team, Bernard.

177
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,417
当然了  队友  我很乐意
Sure thing, teammate. I'm so excited.

178
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,699
来吧  击掌
Now, hit me up top.

179
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:47,192
能不能下来点
How about I hit you up the middle?

180
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,360
好的
Okay.

182
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,597
我们两个要加紧训练  准备拿下那场联赛  哈  怎样
Now, let's win this tournament. Bam! What?!

184
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:57,402
不错啊  我能试试么
I like that. Can I give it a try?

185
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,170
你懂得  这是我的菜
I mean, you know, it's kind of my thing,

186
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,205
试试看吧
but try it.

187
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,275
好吧
Okay.

188
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,343
哈  怎样
Bam! What?!

190
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:11,616
兄弟  你说“哈  怎样”和我一样自然啊
You, my good sir, are a natural bam-what-er.

191
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,738
来吧  开始吧
Let's do this, come on.

193
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,557
好吧
Okay.

194
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:20,492
你得稍微
Just got to get a little...

195
00:09:20,494 --> 00:09:22,695
你得稍微热热身  对吧  伯纳德
Just got to get a little warmed up, right, Bernie?

197
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:29,434
嗯  你这
I... I think you... uh...

198
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:32,337
你应该单手拍球
It's more of like a... Like... like one hand.

200
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,776
赞
Yes!

201
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:40,378
我打在背板上了
I hit the backboard.

202
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:43,515
我很给力哦
I am on fire.

203
00:09:45,284 --> 00:09:47,419
呃  伯纳德
Uh, Bernard?

204
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:51,323
你说你大学里面打过篮球
Thought you said you played in college.

205
00:09:51,325 --> 00:09:55,860
全国垃圾桶篮球联赛
In the national trash can basketball association.

206
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,533
坐在在办公室椅子上
We used to roll around on office chairs

207
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:03,668
往垃圾桶里面扔纸团
and shoot up wadded-up paper. Whoo.

208
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:09,874
呃  垃圾桶篮球
Uh, trash can basketball?

209
00:10:09,876 --> 00:10:11,610
- 对的  垃圾桶篮球  - 哦
- Yeah, trash can basketball. - Oh.

210
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,645
我连续三年都是
I won defensive player of the year

211
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,680
最佳后卫
three years in a row.

212
00:10:16,682 --> 00:10:18,583
哦  好吧
Yes, okay?

213
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:20,485
我以貌取人了
I judged a book by its cover.

214
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,153
不过拜托
But come on!

215
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,835
这人丈二高啊
It was a seven-foot book!

216
00:10:26,425 --> 00:10:28,126
嘿  妈
Hey, mom.

217
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,260
你在这真好
I'm so glad you're here.

218
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:31,529
关于这个角色  我考虑了很久
So I've been thinking about this role

219
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,198
我觉得我的理解方向错了
and I think I had it all wrong.

220
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,267
她不是个过度操劳的家庭主妇
She's not a haggard, broken-down housewife.

221
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,535
而是个超级老妈
She's a super-mom

222
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:39,657
无往不利  风度翩翩
who gets it all done and looks great doing it.

223
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,407
为了准备演好那个角色
So to prepare for that role,

224
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:45,176
我想我知道体验生活的最佳人选了
I think I know the perfect person to talk to.

225
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:48,446
这  你真好
That is... that is so sweet.

226
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,649
我的德语老师  莱夫施奈德女士
Mrs. Reifschneider, my German teacher.

227
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:56,221
有住家保姆的那位
The one with the live-in housekeeper?

228
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,891
很好  不错  去吧
Yeah. Yeah! Yeah!

229
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:03,495
去体验她的生活吧  去吧
Ask her. Ask her.

230
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:10,168
丽芙  我有大麻烦了
Liv, I have a huge problem.

231
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,436
洗耳恭听
Uh, I'm listening.

232
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,605
我的麻烦是伯纳德
Okay, it's just the thing with Bernard is...

233
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:14,773
等等  等等
Uh, hold on. Hold on.

234
00:11:14,775 --> 00:11:15,907
妈
Mom!

235
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,375
啥
Huh?

236
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:19,310
您介意不
Do you mind?

237
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:21,646
何止一点点
More than you know.

238
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,583
- 继续  - 好的  只是
- Go on. - Okay, I just...

239
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,951
我本来觉得伯纳德会是个不错的队友
I thought Bernard would be a better teammate,

240
00:11:26,953 --> 00:11:28,286
结果没想到他的球技糟糕透顶
but he's terrible.

241
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:29,454
比老爸还臭
Worse than dad?

242
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,855
臭不可闻
Way worse than dad.

243
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,257
他的裤子呢
Are his shorts as bad?

244
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:35,293
裤子倒没有比老爸的更难看的
No shorts are that bad.

246
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:37,862
关键在于我要是和伯纳德组队
But the point is I'm not gonna

247
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,230
我怎么找都赢不了那场联赛
win the tournament with Bernard.

248
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,598
我得想个办法把他踢掉
So I need to figure out a way to ditch him

249
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,766
回头找老爸
and get dad back.

250
00:11:41,768 --> 00:11:43,702
你怎么突然要回到老爸身边了
Why would you want dad back?

251
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,271
到这个节骨眼上再想换队友已经不现实了
Because it's too late to get anyone else...

252
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,277
何况他是我爸  我深爱着他
And because he's my father and I love him.

254
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,713
我怎么办
What am I gonna do?

255
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:56,781
我觉得你知道了
Oh, I think you know.

256
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:58,516
闭上眼睛  一起冥想
Close your eyes and let's visualize

257
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:01,753
这个问题最好的解决方案
the best possible solution to your problem.

259
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,996
看啊  我是个水果维京海盗
Check it out. I'm a fruit viking.

261
00:12:23,976 --> 00:12:25,477
好了  伯纳德
All right, Bernard.

262
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,378
我根据合理的预期值
Now, I have set a fitness goal for myself

263
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,749
给自己设定了一个健身目标
based on completely reasonable expectations.

264
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:33,384
我想要你
I want you to make me

265
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:36,554
把我训练成乔伊 2.5
into Joey 2.5.

266
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,527
不错吧  呵呵
Uh, ah? Nice, huh?

267
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,462
我的肩膀比你的还宽呢
I even have shoulders bigger than yours.

268
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:48,900
天底下没有一个人的肩膀比我的宽
Nobody has shoulders bigger than me.

269
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,771
比这个肩膀宽的
The only shoulder in the world bigger than this one

270
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,839
只有这边的
is this one.

271
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,842
抱歉了  兄弟  但这就是事实
Sorry, but it's true.

272
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,678
你今天打算怎么训练
Okay, so what's the plan for today?

273
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,514
乔伊  我先要确定一下
All right, Joey, I want to determine

274
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:03,715
你的基准心率
your target heart rate.

275
00:13:03,717 --> 00:13:05,517
我们做几个下蹲起立
We're gonna do some squats,

276
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,485
做几个仰卧起坐
some crunches,

277
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,421
然后再慢跑几英里
Then we're gonna jog a couple Miles.

279
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,659
那是什么声音
What is that noise?

280
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,061
没想到你就光听我谈论运动
Somehow, you've exceeded your target heart rate

281
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:21,399
心率就飚的这么高
by just listening to me talk about exercise.

282
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:24,469
那么就是说我们今天的目标达成了咯
So, we're done for the day.

285
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:30,875
乔伊  我们还没开始呢
Joey, we haven't even started yet.

286
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,344
准备流汗吧
Now, get ready to sweat!

288
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,984
这真好玩
This is fun.

289
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:41,820
对心血管又好
Plus, it's great cardio

290
00:13:41,822 --> 00:13:43,755
而且关节压力不大
and it's easy on the joints.

291
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,523
压力不大
Oh, easy,

292
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,559
正如我意
that is the word I've been looking for.

293
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,029
这下你能锻炼四肢
You can totally blast your quads

294
00:13:51,031 --> 00:13:53,498
很均衡的全身运动
and get a great core workout

295
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,400
你只要来回跳跃
by just hopping from side-to-side.

296
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:57,402
算了  兄弟
Nah, man.

297
00:13:57,404 --> 00:14:00,004
我原地跳跳就行了
I'm good just boinging in place.

298
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,141
乔伊 2.5 不是靠原地跳出来的
Joey 2.5 doesn't boing in place!

299
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,743
不要啊  够了
No! Hey! We're done.

300
00:14:05,745 --> 00:14:06,845
够了  你的意思我懂了
We're done. You've made your point.

301
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,047
- 够了  - 我能加入么
- We're done. - May I?

302
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,049
来吧
Please do.

303
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,084
不要啊  来人啊
No! Somebody!

304
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:15,566
行了
Okay, we're done.

305
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:21,793
爸  我们能谈谈么
Hey, dad. Can we talk?

306
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:23,962
说吧
Sure.

307
00:14:23,964 --> 00:14:26,631
好像我们上次谈的很有成果似的
Since it went so well the last time we did.

308
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:31,436
爸  我犯了个错误
Look, I made a mistake.

309
00:14:31,438 --> 00:14:34,572
我觉得我终于理解我们一起打球的目的
I think I finally realized that the whole point

310
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:38,543
是为了一起赢下那场联赛
was for us to win this tournament together.

311
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,512
是啊  那是我们打球的目的
You're right. That was the whole point.

312
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,116
既然这样  那就继续训练吧
Well, back to practice.

313
00:14:45,118 --> 00:14:47,518
真的  我这就去换衣服
Really? I'm gonna go get changed.

314
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,754
哦  不  不  不
Oh, no, no, no.

315
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:50,989
我不是和你训练
Not with you...

316
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:53,658
我找了个新队友
With my new teammate.

317
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,498
你找了个什么
Your new what-mate?

318
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,634
迪吉
Diggy?

319
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,137
别来无恙  鲁尼
'Sup, Rooney?

322
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:14,178
我说过职业巅峰的皮特·鲁尼会把他打球的节奏找回来
Told you prime-time Pete Rooney would find his rhythm.

323
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,915
准备好  我这就要
Ring the alarm bells 'cause I'm on...

324
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:20,818
火力全开
Fire.

325
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,054
可是我是你女儿
Wait, but I'm your daughter.

326
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:24,756
你怎么能这么对我
How could you do this to me?

327
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:27,425
因为迪吉不会在我背后捅刀子
Because Diggy knows not to stab me in the back.

328
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,495
而且他球技不错  起跳有力
Plus, he's a great player with a solid jumper

329
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:33,531
着装也很有品味
and impeccable fashion sense.

331
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:43,441
如果你想要让你的对手心神不宁
If you were trying to psych-out your competition,

332
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,575
你们的你的任务达成了
mission accomplished.

337
00:15:58,657 --> 00:16:00,725
别来无恙  迪吉
'Sup, Diggy?

338
00:16:00,727 --> 00:16:03,861
好吧  你先听我说
Okay, before you say anything,

339
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,130
很抱歉我和你爸组队了
I'm sorry that I teamed up with your dad...

340
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,100
也很抱歉我在你面前穿了那条裤子
And that you had to see me in those shorts.

342
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,738
放心  迪吉  我没生你的气
Relax, Diggy. I'm not upset with you.

343
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,206
你没生我的气
You're not?

344
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:18,042
哇  没想到你这么淡定
Wow, that's really cool of you.

345
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:20,211
你是很淡定  对吧
You are being really cool, right?

346
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,716
- 姐淡定着呢  - 好的
- Way cool. - Okay.

347
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:26,484
只不过
It's just...

348
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:27,986
真不幸
It's too bad though.

349
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:30,154
天啊  怎么不幸了
Whoa, wait. What's too bad?

350
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,823
哦  你懂的
Oh, you know, it's just

351
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:34,859
我们不是一队的了  也就是说我们是对手了
we're on different teams now and so we're enemies.

352
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,261
而我觉不会对对手手下留情
And I've sworn to crush all my enemies!

353
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:40,798
你的意思是说我不能参赛了咯
Are you saying that I can't play

354
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,169
我不会要你做什么的
I would never tell you what to do.

355
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:47,005
- 好吧  - 嘿
- Okay. - Hey, uh...

356
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,107
你还记得当年我们去溜冰
Do you remember that one time that we went ice skating

357
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:50,174
我冻得瑟瑟发抖
and I got cold?

358
00:16:50,176 --> 00:16:51,676
当然记得
Of course.

359
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:53,978
那是我们两个第一次一起出去玩
It was the first time we ever hung out together.

360
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,515
- 你很可爱  - 是啊  这是你当时给我的围巾
- You were so cute. - Yeah, here's the scarf that you loaned me.

361
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:01,886
好吧
Okay, all right.

362
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:03,154
我真心感觉你的言下之意
I'm really getting the feeling you're saying

363
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:04,522
是叫我不要参加这场联赛
not to play in that tournament.

364
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:07,892
我可什么都没说
I'm not saying anything.

365
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,127
这是你塞进我柜子里面的
Here's a collection of every single note

366
00:17:09,129 --> 00:17:10,128
每一条小纸条
that you've ever left in my locker.

367
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,863
可以了
Okay, okay.

368
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,832
我懂了  我会
I get it. I will, uh...

369
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:16,534
我会想办法从你爸的队伍里面离开的
I'll find a way to get off your dad's team.

370
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,238
既然如此
I mean...

371
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,273
既然你真心想要这样
If that's what you really want.

372
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,149
教练  我是真心想要参赛
And I really want to play, coach,

373
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,584
只是这手臂有伤
but, ugh, my arm just hurts so bad.

374
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,587
让我直接从巅峰跌落谷底
Cut down in my prime!

375
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:39,624
超短裤队损失不小啊  是不是  老爸
It's a tough blow to team short-shorts, isn't it, dad?

376
00:17:39,626 --> 00:17:42,026
当然
It sure is.

377
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,328
斯摩尔斯先生  我问你一个问题
Let me ask you one question, Mr. Smalls.

378
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,331
有没有这种可能  玛蒂给你施加了种种压力
Would Maddie, by any chance, be pressuring you...

379
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,067
让你
I don't know... to...

380
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,235
装做这样
Fake this?

381
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,570
马脚漏出来了
Ha ha!

382
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,206
小弟  这女孩对你可不是好消息
That girl's no good for you, son.

383
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:57,642
啥  爸  你又不喜欢迪吉
What... dad, you don't even like Diggy.

384
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,677
这才不是实话  他人品不错
That's not true. He's a fine young man.

385
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,413
- 真的  伯父  - 迪吉  你别插嘴
- Really, sir? - Stay out of it, Diggy.

386
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,049
- 你别管迪吉的事  - 不可能  我是篮球队教练
- You leave Diggy alone. - No, I'm the basketball coach.

387
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:08,319
你们两个给我消停一点
You two, knock it off!

388
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:11,622
- 痛  痛  痛  - 行了  妈
- Ow, ow, ow. - Okay, mom!

389
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:13,291
我不知道这场争论是谁挑起的
Now, I don't know who started this war,

390
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,960
不过我得踩刹车了  你们两个给我到厨房去
but I'm ending it. Get in the kitchen.

391
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,595
现在就去
Now.

392
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,230
走啊
Now!

394
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,371
漂亮  好啊
Awesome! Yeah!

395
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,675
最后一堂课  我希望你能严加要求
I really want you to dig in on this last session.

396
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,743
我觉得我进步不小
I feel like I've made a lot of progress.

397
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,046
进步马
Progress?

398
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:36,080
当然
Sure.

401
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,386
这叫进步
Progress.

402
00:18:42,388 --> 00:18:44,789
这就是他所谓的进步
He said progress.

403
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,657
好了
Okey dokey.

404
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,260
开始吧  伯纳德大哥
Let's do this, Bernasty.

405
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:52,063
伯啥
Bern-who?

406
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:55,399
伯  你还没到我给你起绰号的地步
Berna... you are not ready for nicknames.

407
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:58,202
- 只要不是你就行了  - 漂亮的  大个子兄弟
- Not from you. - Good one, tree top.

408
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:00,304
多谢  帕克小弟
Thanks, p-train.

409
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:03,107
好吧  约瑟夫  这个练习很简单
All right, Joseph. This is simple.

410
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,376
你只要顶住这些弹力带
All you have to do is run to me

411
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:07,678
跑到我这里就可以
while fighting those resistance bands.

412
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,680
小事一桩
Oh, piece of cake.

413
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,684
并非所有事都是小事一桩
Everything is not a dessert.

414
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:19,157
你就像后面墙壁要倒在你身上一样往我这里跑
Run to me as though the walls are chasing you!

415
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:22,059
我能想象是一群僵尸在追我么
Ooh, can I imagine a zombie?

416
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:24,395
如果你要这样  也行
If you must.

417
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,666
努力  乔伊  努力  乔伊
Come on, Joey. Dig, Joey!

418
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,234
你只要能碰到我的手掌
All you have to do is touch my hand

419
00:19:30,236 --> 00:19:32,436
你就能成为乔伊 2.5
and you'll be Joey 2.5.

422
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:42,246
现在我无人能敌了
Whoo! No one can stop me now!

423
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:45,216
去你的
Buh-bye.

425
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,322
嘿  你愿不愿意在生日派对上表演
Hey, do you do birthday parties?

426
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:53,691
我的朋友们会很喜欢你的
My pals will really enjoy you.

427
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,360
小事一桩  帕克兄弟
Any time, p-train. Up top.

430
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:01,832
嗯  两位
Uh, guys.

431
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,335
两位大哥
Dudes?

432
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,871
能不能来帮个忙啊  大个子
A little help over here, tree top?

433
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:09,307
帕克兄弟
P-train?

434
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,908
救命啊  伯纳德大哥
Help me, bernasty!

436
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,480
你们两个犟头倔脑的家伙
You two are so stubborn.

437
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:20,151
这个世界上有不少比胜利更重要的事情
Can we at least agree there are more important things than winning?

439
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:25,056
你们两个从玛蒂五岁起
You two have been playing basketball together

440
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,324
就一起打篮球了
since Maddie was five.

441
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,260
现在你们两个却为了篮球吵得面红耳赤
And now you’re gonna let this wonderful thing you share tear you apart?

442
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,729
- 她先挑起的  - 他先挑起的
- She started it. - He started it.

443
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,332
我觉得你们两个简直就一个模子里刻出来的
I swear, it's like you two are the same person.

445
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,002
是啊  真够意想不到的
I know, shocking.

446
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,170
现在  你们两个把这事给谈开了
Now figure it out.

447
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,307
这世上是不是真的
It is possible

448
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:46,344
有比胜利更重要的事情
that there are things more important in life than winning?

449
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:50,381
这话听着别扭  对不对
Doesn't seem right, does it?

450
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:53,384
很抱歉我把你踢出队了  老爸
I'm sorry I dumped you, dad.

451
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:56,287
我也很抱歉我把你踢出队了
I'm sorry I dumped you back.

452
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,258
我们现在是不是该拥抱一下了
Are we supposed to hug now or something?

453
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,459
我宁愿去打球
I'd rather go play basketball.

454
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,861
- 那就赶紧去打球吧  - 走吧
- Let's play basketball. - Yeah.

455
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:07,198
嘿  听着  迪吉
Hey, listen, Diggy.

456
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,534
我还是和玛蒂组队
Um, Maddie and I got back together.

457
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,937
放马来吧
Beat it.

458
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,139
这样的话我也不至于难以启齿了
That actually makes this less awkward.

459
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:17,208
我和大兄弟组队
I'm teaming up with the big man.

460
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,444
如果你们还有什么疑问
And if anyone's confused,

461
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,513
我就是大兄弟
I'm the big man.

462
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:25,950
只是提醒你一下  迪吉
Just a warning, Diggy.

463
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,386
大兄弟可是个大错误啊
That big man is a big mistake.

464
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:32,323
伯纳德戴上眼镜可就牛多了
Bernard is a lot better with his goggles.

468
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:48,039
哈  怎样
Bam! What?!

470
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:54,078
我要是能看见篮筐  表现就给力多了
I'm so much better when I can actually see the hoop.

471
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,814
祝你们比赛好运
Good luck in the tournament,

472
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,849
输家
losers.

474
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,455
别
Stop.

475
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,166
亲爱的  我知道在联赛上
Honey, I know it was hard to lose

476
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,068
输给伯纳德和迪吉的滋味不好受
the championship game to Diggy and Bernard,

477
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,436
不过比赛既然结束了
but the tournament's over.

478
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:19,537
你也改歇一歇了吧
You need to give it up, Pete.

479
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,172
我们明年还有机会能赢回来
But we can win next year.

480
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,540
我指的是你的短裤
No, no. I meant your Daisy Dukes...

481
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,845
你穿着这个  谁都赢不了
'Cause no one wins when you wear those.

482
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:31,248
嘿  职业巅峰的皮特·鲁尼练习了不少
Hey, prime-time Pete Rooney's been practicing a lot.

483
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,583
球技都回来了
He's got his groove back.

484
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:34,485
你看看这个
He'd like you to check this out.

485
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:37,955
盖帽
Oh-ho!

486
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:40,491
正中靶心  大爷
In your face, old man!

488
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,428
锻炼是很有趣
Exercise is fun.
