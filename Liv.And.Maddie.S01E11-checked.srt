1
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:10,775
好了  丽芙和玛蒂很快就要考完驾照回家了
Okay, Liv and Maddie will be back from their driving test any second.

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,444
准备好庆祝仪式了么
Ready to celebrate?

3
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,112
来看看
Check it.

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,384
放声高唱
Sing it loud!
（威斯康星州机动车驾驶执照）

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,386
哈  怎样
Bam! What?!
（驾照持有人 丽芙·鲁尼 玛蒂·鲁尼）

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,656
我简直等不及我拿到驾照
Ooh, I can't wait to get my license

7
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,658
能随心所欲开车去任何地方的那一刻了
and be able to go wherever I want.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,460
当然在市域范围内
Within the city limits.

9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,061
在爸妈不准我出门之前
Before my curfew.

10
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,031
开的还是个闻起来像乔伊臭脚的破面包车
In a beat-up minivan that smells like Joey's feet.

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,433
还是无比自由啊
Still freedom.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,668
万岁
Whoo-hoo!

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,769
这叫自由
Freedom?

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,639
这是失去自由好不好
Try loss of freedom.

15
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,507
谁会在无比烦躁还想发短信发到大拇指抽筋
Who wants to drive when you can sit shotgun

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,109
的时候专心开车啊
and text until your thumbs fall off?

17
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,477
肯定不是我
Not me.

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,546
我真为玛蒂兴奋  拿到了驾照
I'm stoked for Maddie. Having a license...

19
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,481
意味着她可以去任何地方干任何事了
that means she can go anywhere and do anything.

20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,550
像她这么负责任的青少年一定会
That a responsible teenager would do

21
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,184
先在严父这里得到批准
after getting approval from her father.

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,354
我怎么会让她不得到您的恩准就胡作非为呢
Not that I've ever asked her not to get approval.

23
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,622
为什么我还在滔滔不绝呢
Why am I still talking?

25
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,824
为什么你在我房子里呢
Why are you in my house?

26
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,459
为什么你不去理个发呢
Why haven't you gotten a haircut?

27
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,129
我们的问题都不少啊
We've all got questions.

28
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,231
她来了
There she is.

29
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,766
祝贺了  丽芙
Congratulations, Liv.

30
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,235
咱们的两个新司机之一
One of our two new drivers.

31
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,770
先别急着喝彩
Yes. Hold your rah-rahs.

32
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,205
我们中只有一个过了考试
Only one of us passed.

33
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,174
真是倒霉催了啊
Total bummer-rang.

34
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,776
啊  你下次就会拿到驾照了  孩子
Aw, you'll get it next time, kid.

35
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,679
不  我才是过了考试的那个
No. I'm the one who passed.

36
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,481
激动人心吧
License to surprise!

37
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,851
等等  如果你过了  就说明玛蒂没过考试
Wait, if you passed, that means Maddie failed.

38
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,554
玛蒂从来没考过不及格
Maddie doesn't fail anything.

39
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,822
- 哦  - 噢
- Ooh! - Oh!

41
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,294
快烧了  全都烧了
Burn it! Burn it all!

43
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,564
好吧
Well...

44
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,733
我没及格
I failed.

45
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,835
想必我终于知道失败的滋味了
Guess I know what it feels like to be a loser now.

46
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,638
就是乔伊你特别熟悉的那种滋味
You know what I'm talking about, Joey.

47
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,842
哎呀  如果你拿到驾照了
Ouch! I would call that a drive-by...

48
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,844
也算是狗屎运吧
if you had your license.

50
00:01:57,883 --> 00:01:59,250
到底发生了什么
So what happened?

51
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,752
我跟你讲发生了什么吧
I will tell you what happened.

52
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,587
车管所太歧视人了
The DMV discriminates.
（DMV：Department Of Motor Vehicles，车管所)

53
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,756
他们只把驾照发给能够
Yeah. They only give their licenses

54
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,826
完成左转弯的人
to people who can make left-hand turns.

55
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,796
如果你想把车往左开  这招确实有用
They do come in handy when you want to go left.

56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,499
为啥你要自找没事地开到
Why would you purposefully turn

57
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,368
一堆乱糟糟的车流里而抵达你本需
into oncoming traffic when you can go up one block

58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,869
右拐三次就能到的地方
and make three rights?

59
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,806
谁这么急着要驾照啊  对不
Who needs their license anyway, am I right?

60
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,843
我啊  我要我的驾照啊
I do! I need my license!

61
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,912
别担心  玛蒂  我会开车带你去你想去的地方的
Don't worry, Maddie. I'll drive you anywhere you want to go.

62
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,314
我怎么还叽里呱啦说个不停啊
Seriously, why am I still talking?

63
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,715
我怎么还站在这里啊
Why am I still here?

64
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,250
我马上去把头发理了
I'll go get my hair cut.

66
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,823
最好的朋友
Better in stereo

67
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,892
不同的朋友
b... b... better in stereo

68
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,927
迎着清晨阳光
-  I'm up with the sunshine -  Let's go

69
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,530
穿上舒服衣裳
-  I lace up my high tops -  Oh no

70
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,365
扣篮  热热身
slam dunk, ready or not

71
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,933
秀出你的份量
yeah, show me what you got

72
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,536
站在舞台中央
-  I'm under the spotlight -  Holler

73
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,538
准备下一场较量
I dare you, come on and follow

74
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,807
你有你的节拍
you dance to your own beat

75
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,809
我的歌声嘹亮
I'll sing the melody

76
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,512
你想接受
when you say yea-ah-ah

77
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,447
我却摇头
I say no-oh-oh

78
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,716
你想停留
when you say stop

79
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,218
我却一心只想  走走走
all I want to do is go go go

80
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,221
你  我最好的朋友
you you, the other half of me me

81
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,223
学不来的朋友
the half I'll never be-e

82
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,894
截然不同的朋友
the half that drives me crazy

83
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,897
你  我最好的朋友
you you, the better half of me me

84
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,366
离不开的朋友
the half I'll always need

85
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,834
你我有
but we both know

86
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,836
不或缺的朋友
we're better in stereo.

89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,777
各位  我有个大好消息要宣布一下
Guys! I have something really exciting to say.

90
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:37,248
你能不能先闭嘴两个小时
How about you pause your piehole for two hours?

91
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,785
我们待会再聊
We'll get to you later.

92
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,288
我们都洗耳恭听了  丽芙
We're all listening, Liv.

93
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,456
很好
Okay.

94
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,624
今年夏天在威斯康星州
There is a major film

95
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,493
有一部大电影要进行拍摄
shooting in Wisconsin this summer,

96
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,728
我被提名参演一个主要角色
and I'm up for a big part.

97
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,829
真刺激  电影讲什么的
How exciting! What's it about?

98
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,966
大概是关于一群狼崽子在太空里的吧
It's based on some book about wolves in space.

99
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,603
《太空狼人》
"Space Werewolves!"

100
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,807
这是我最喜欢的漫画小说了
That is my favorite graphic novel.

101
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,042
不会吧
No way!

102
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,844
他们想让我饰演特里斯坦
They want me to play Tristan.

103
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,480
莫非是特里斯坦·莱肯
As in Tristan Lycanth?

104
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,481
对
Yeah.

105
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,950
那个英雄
The hero?

106
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,918
哈哈  特里斯坦是个男孩
Ha ha, but Tristan's a boy.

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,854
准确地说是半狼人半男孩
Technically half-boy, half-werewolf.

108
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,923
但他绝对不会是个女孩子
But he is definitely not a girl.

109
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,926
对  暂时还不是
Right. Not yet.

110
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,362
但是制片人看了我在《放声歌唱》里的表现
But the people making the movie saw my episode of Sing it Loud!

111
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,766
就是我在国际空间站里唱女高音
right where I dreamt that I was on an international space station

112
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,367
打碎了本要撞击地球的小行星
and I saved the earth by singing the high note

113
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,469
拯救了芸芸众生的那一集
that shattered the asteroid before it hit earth. Aah!

116
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,308
我太喜欢那集了
I love that episode.

117
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,410
真的吗 我觉得这里面逻辑错误不少啊
Really? 'Cause I had some logic problems with it.

118
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,678
但是你太出彩了 亲爱的
But you sparkled, honey.

119
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,816
他们实在是太喜欢我了 甚至要考虑把原著的男性角色
They liked it so much that they're considering changing the role of Tristan

120
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,385
为了我而改成女的
into a girl just for me.

121
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,722
我为了丽芙着想  必须要阻止她
I had to stop Liv for her own good.

122
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,624
脑残粉太痴狂了
Fanboys are crazy.

123
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,325
我明白这点  因为我也是其中之一
I should know. I'm one of them.

125
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,729
那可是特里斯坦·莱肯啊
We're talking about Tristan Lycanth.

126
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,865
自由世界的捍卫者啊
Keeper of the claw of freedom.

127
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,736
这俩根本就摆不到一起去
Does this match this?

129
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,010
- 你好啊  迪吉  - 你好啊  鲁尼
- What's up, Diggie? - What's up, Rooney?

130
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,813
你的头发怎么了
'Sup with your hair?

131
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,782
你不会只听了我爸啰嗦几句
You did not get a haircut

132
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,317
就把头发理了吧
just because my dad told you to.

133
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,520
不  怎么会
No. Not at all.

134
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,056
我只是觉得头发太长罢了  你认为他会喜欢我的新发型么
I totally needed a trim. Do you think he'll like it?

135
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:28,927
迪吉  你可不能对他言听计从啊
Diggie, you can't let him push you around like this.

136
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,595
我是说  尽管你之前的头发是一团乱麻
I mean, your hair was a hot mess,

137
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,764
但这不是重点啊
but that's not the point.

138
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,566
我根本控制不住  行不  我想让他喜欢我啊
I can't help it, okay? I want him to like me.

139
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,800
他可是你爸  而我们俩是
He's your dad. And you and me are...

140
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,036
管它是什么呢
Whatever we are.

141
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,672
对啊  管它呢
Totally. Whatever.

142
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,042
呃  你需要找一个
Um... you just need to find something

143
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,910
你和我爸都喜欢的爱好  以此来拉近关系
that you and my dad both like and bond over that.

144
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,512
噢  对  太好了  让我看看
Oh, yeah, okay, great. Let's see.

145
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,081
他喜欢对我大吼大叫
He likes growling at me.

146
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,916
你知道他还喜欢什么吗
You know what else he likes...

147
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,117
烧烤
barbecuing.

148
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,920
烤肉架确实比大嗓门好多了
Grilling sure beats growling.

149
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,857
而且  如果他开始喜欢我了
And, if he starts to like me,

150
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,358
我就可以帮你准备驾照考试了
I could help you prep for your driver's test.

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,993
哎呀呀
Aww.

152
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,495
真贴心啊
That's so sweet.

153
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,930
老爸你好啊
Hey, Dad.

155
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,902
我跟你开玩笑呢  亲  哈哈
Dude, I'm kidding. Ha ha.

156
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,437
但他可不会跟你开玩笑
But he won't be.

157
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,443
噢  嘿  丽芙  你想来点巧克力布丁么
Oh! Hey, Liv, you want some chocolate pudding?

158
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,445
我们在冰箱里发现了一大碗
We found a big bowl of it in the fridge.

159
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,814
呃  二位  这可不是巧克力布丁
Um, boys, that's not chocolate pudding.

160
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,049
这是我的从巴黎运来的有机面膜
That's my organic face mask from Paris.

161
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,985
哦  吼吼吼
Oh, ho ho ho.

162
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,754
特制的布丁啊
Fancy pudding.

163
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,956
对  这是用猩猩的大便做出来的
Yeah. It's made with orangutan poop.

165
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,063
这猴子的伙食真是不错啊
Well, whatever that monkey ate was delicious.

166
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,835
我吃了块香蕉么
Is that banana?

167
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,403
好吧  只要
Okay, just...

168
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,805
恶心哟  乔伊
Eww, Joey...

170
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,141
听好了
Get this.

171
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,010
不知道谁在网上散布了小道消息
Somehow word has spread through the blogosphere

172
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,512
说我可能要饰演《太空狼人》里的特里斯坦
that I'm up for the role of Tristan in "Space Werewolves."

173
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,182
我们绝不知道消息是怎么泄露到网上的
Not sure how that info leaked out onto the Internet.

174
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,451
我们怎么会把这么要紧的大新闻发到
We would never post that juicy tidbit

175
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,221
“史蒂文斯波因特《太空狼人》粉丝群”里
on the Stevens Point "Space Werewolves" fan page

176
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,556
来惹毛这帮狼人粉呢
in hopes of enraging local Tristanites.

178
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,761
丽芙到时候会感谢我所做的一切的
Liv will thank me for this later.

179
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,462
让我猜猜
Let me guess.

180
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,564
你饰演特里斯坦的话  脑残粉们
The fanboys were none too pleased

181
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,566
肯定会把你批判一番的
about you playing Tristan.

182
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,968
你也许要看清形势
You probably want to throw in the towel

183
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,070
知难而退了吧
and back out.

184
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,505
呃  不
Uh, no.

185
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,973
我跟这帮脑子进水的家伙纠结个什么呢
I mean, why do I care what nerd nation

186
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,977
因为我们是一股强大的势力
Because we are a powerful force to be reckoned with...

187
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,579
我是说  他们才是
I mean, they are!

188
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,914
随便吧
Whatever.

189
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,616
这周末我要在纳维尔礼品店店参加
This weekend I have a personal appearance

190
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,751
一个见面会  签售《放声歌唱》的光盘
at Neville's Novelty Shoppe to sign "Sing it Loud!" DVDs.

191
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,019
你们干嘛不跟我来呢
Why don't you guys come with me?

192
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,490
丽芙  纳维尔商店是脑残粉的大本营啊
Liv, Neville's is fanboy central.

193
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,061
如果他们发现你对《太空狼人》的情节一无所知
and then find out that you don't know what you're talking about

194
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,562
就会把你生吞活剥的
they will eat you alive.

195
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,632
这是个生活在太空的狼人故事
He's a werewolf and he lives in space.

196
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,600
我觉得我还需要学习的内容都在这本书里了
I think anything else I need to learn about him will be in here.

197
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,869
我大概周六前就能看完了吧
I can probably finish this by Saturday, yeah?

198
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,104
丽芙  这是第一卷
Liv, that's volume 1.

199
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,940
总共有 64 卷呢
There are 64 volumes.

200
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,141
嗬
Hah!

201
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,910
怪不得他们要把书翻拍成电影
No wonder they're making this into a movie.

202
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,778
谁有工夫看完这么多书啊
Who would want to read all that?

203
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,917
呃
Ugh!

204
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,685
呃
Ugh!

205
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,022
一本交规
323 pages

206
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,590
323 页
of "Rules of the Road,"

207
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,825
而编者只字未提
and not once did they admit

208
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,593
左转进一堆车流里
that turning left into oncoming traffic

209
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,595
是很蠢的
is insane.

210
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,666
420 页的狼人和飞船的故事
420 pages of werewolves and spaceships,

211
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,934
而其中唯一我认真看的就是
and the only thing I'm really looking is that

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,761
我穿上特里斯坦的宇航服帅呆了
I think I could totally rock Tristan's space suit.

213
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,871
没错啊
Yeah...

214
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,840
等你看到穆尔斯战役那一段
just wait till they get to the Battle of Mirth.

216
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,242
也就是他遇见凯特拉那段
That's when he meets Kytra,

217
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,910
再后面的历险故事就引人入胜了
and that's when the adventure really kicks off.

219
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,216
你这科幻迷藏得够深啊
You undercover Sci-Fi geek.

220
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,552
你完全就读过这本书
You've totally read this book.

221
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,987
对  我其实全套都看了
Yeah, I've actually read them all.

222
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,789
我很喜欢这书  而且我必须承认
I love them. And I have to admit...

223
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,792
我其实看你去饰演特里斯坦是持观望态度的
I am a little on the fence about you playing Tristan myself.

224
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,595
好吧  其一  你怎敢这么说
Okay... one, how dare you.

225
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,232
其二  帮帮我吧
And two, help me.

226
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,734
得了吧  丽芙  你急个什么呢
Okay, Liv, why are you wigging out?

227
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,636
因为我真的很想要这个角色啊
Because I really want this role.

228
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,937
我知道我已经是个明星了
I mean, I know that I've been playing it cool,

229
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,939
但是参演的这部电影分量最大
but this is way bigger than my show

230
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,176
还能完全把我的演艺事业提升到一片崭新的空间
and it could send me into a completely new acting stratosphere.

231
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,279
但我却不知道怎么给脑残粉留下深刻的印象
I just have no idea how to impress these fanboys.

232
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,781
呃  好吧  我的确很想帮你
Okay, well, I would love to help you

233
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,682
但是  丽芙  我的驾照考试和你的
but, Liv, my driver's test is on the same day

234
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,984
签售会在同一天啊
as your autograph signing.

235
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,185
而我还不知道怎么
And I still have no idea

236
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,587
完成这个愚蠢的左转弯
how to make a stupid left-hand turn.

237
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,624
我有个疯狂的好主意啦
I have a twin-sane idea!

238
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,028
这周六  我就是你而你就是我
This Saturday, I'll be you and you be me.

239
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,696
- 等下  你指的是  - 姐妹身份对调
- Wait, you mean like... - A switch-a-Rooney.

241
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,868
我去摆平这帮脑残粉
I'll face your fanboys.

242
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,737
而你帮我把驾照拿到手
And I will take your driver's test.

243
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,639
太完美了
Perfect!

244
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,274
为什么你的床黏糊糊的
Why is this bed so squishy?

246
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,950
因为我坐在一摊比萨饼上啊
Because I am sitting on a pizza.

247
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,053
体谅一下半夜饿肚子的女孩吧
A girl gets hungry at 3:00 A.M.

249
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,763
这就是我杀死猛龙的全过程
Web... and that's how I slay the dragon.

250
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,867
嘿  亚蒂  你有空么
Hey, Artie, you got a minute?

251
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,968
你好啊  乔伊
Hey, Joey.

252
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,303
你有女朋友啦
You got a girlfriend?

253
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,805
好啊
Burn!

254
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,176
这怎么会好啊  去年秋天你把你妈带到新生舞会上去了
How is that a burn? You took your mom to the freshman dance last fall.

255
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,083
那是什么风把你吹回了
So, what brings you crawling back

256
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,985
学校的太  太  太
to the Society of Space... Space... space...

257
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,720
空  空  空
Were... were... were... Wol... wol... wol...

258
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,622
狼  狼  狼  人  人  社团
wol... wol... wol... ves... ves?

260
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,227
我只是因为觉得戴个狼尾巴很蠢
I was voted out of the Society

261
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,929
就被投票开除了团籍
for suggesting that wolf tails were stupid.

262
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,631
我错了吗
Was I wrong?

263
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,800
同志们  我哪里错了
People, was I wrong?

264
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,203
我想跟你谈谈我姐丽芙的事
I want to talk to you about my sister Liv.

265
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,872
别  啦啦啦我听不见
No la la la la.

266
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,007
我们绝不会说出那个想亵渎特里斯坦的
We do not speak the name of that she-devil

267
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,676
女魔头的名字
who wants to desecrate Tristan.

268
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,044
除非她委托你来请我陪她跳舞
Unless she sent you to ask me to prom,

269
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,607
这样的话  跟她说我也许会答应
in which case, let her know I say maybe.

270
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,382
不见不散了
Be gone with you.

272
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,653
听好了  亚蒂
Listen, Artie.

273
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,155
我们有个公敌啊
We have a common enemy here,

274
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,789
我们必须通力合作
and we need to work together

275
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,825
来保证特里斯坦的神圣地位
to defend the iconic character

276
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,094
不可被撼动
that is Tristan.

277
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,197
你我原本是强有力的同盟
We were once powerful allies, you and I.

278
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,133
磕碰不断的盟友啊
An uneasy alliance.

279
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,737
我的狼耳朵竖起来了
My wolf ears are perked.

280
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,806
丽芙明天会到纳维尔商店
Liv will be down at Neville's tomorrow.

281
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,442
我要让你给她秀秀《太空狼人》
I need you to show her the real fangs

282
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,112
脑残粉真正的獠牙
of a true "Space Werewolves" fanboy.

283
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,047
脑残粉
Fanboy?

284
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,850
这可是个贬义词啊  同志
That term is derogatory, sir.

285
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,054
我们更喜欢被称作“空想主义爱好者”
We prefer "fantasy enthusiast."

286
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,455
所以你要去砸场子
So will you do it?

287
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,358
哦  听起来爽极了  乔伊
Oh, sounds great, Joey.

288
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,228
我会高兴地跳着舞钻进你的圈套里啊
I'd happily waltz right into your trap.

289
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,463
你把我当傻瓜了吗
Do you take me for a fool?!

290
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,201
是的  我确实把你当傻瓜了
Yes. Yes, I do.

291
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,272
而换做特里斯坦的话就是
But as Tristan himself would say...

292
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,907
当你的敌人
When an enemy

293
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,211
伸出了魔爪  舔一口吧
offers his  paw, lick it.

294
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,447
若你可在明日将他的后腿
If only to tear off his hind leg...

295
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,182
碎成万段
Tomorrow.

296
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,052
哦
Oh!

297
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,220
不去踢馆子就像是
Saying no to that would be like

298
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,188
背叛了特里斯坦一样
saying no to Tristan himself.

299
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,023
干得漂亮  孤狼
Well played, lone wolf.

300
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,025
干得够漂亮
Well played indeed.

302
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,195
啊
Aah!

303
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,299
傻缺
Nerds!

305
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,141
聊天发短信请靠边
Pull over to talk or text.

306
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,946
唔  这块红糖烧肉真是太好吃了
Mmm! Gotta love a brown sugar glaze.

308
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,450
走廊内严禁饮食
No eating in the halls.

309
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,518
我忍不住啊  教练
I can't help it, coach.

310
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,320
这肉真叫入口即化
Just falls off the bone.

311
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,291
你拿的好像是上等的烤牛排啊
That's some solid-looking barbecue you got there.

312
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,293
谢谢
Thank you.

313
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,263
我是看《烧烤月刊》上的步骤做的
I followed a recipe from "Barbecue Monthly."

314
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:50,001
哎呀  黑胡椒放多了
Oh! Too much black pepper.

315
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,036
烧烤真是一门高深的艺术啊
Ah, it was all so confusing.

316
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,372
我爸爸是个
My father's...

317
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,439
素食主义者
A vegetarian.

319
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,044
我一直缺少一位烧烤方面的导师
I just have no one to guide me.

320
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,313
呃  不是我故意炫耀
Well, I don't like to brag,

321
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,982
但是去年夏天我确实在
but last summer I did win

322
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,853
史蒂文斯波因特烧烤比赛中拔得头筹
the Stevens Point "Thrilla on the Grilla" cook-off.

323
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,023
太棒了  鲁尼教练果然吃了烧烤这一套
Oh, yeah! Coach Rooney took the barbecue bait.

324
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,924
但是为什么他对我的发型只字未提
But seriously, not one word about the haircut?

325
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,926
这不是白弄了么
What gives?

326
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,165
嘿 快看啊
Hey, check it out...

327
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,067
我刚把丽芙的牙刷卖给了《放声歌唱》的粉丝
I sold Liv's toothbrush to a "Sing it Loud!" Fan

328
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,202
得到了一堆黏糊糊的眼球糖
and got us a bunch of gummy eyeballs.

330
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,907
真可惜  她只有一把牙刷
Too bad she only has one toothbrush.

331
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,944
哦  开玩笑呢吧  那把牙刷是我在人行道边上捡的
Oh, please... I picked that one off the sidewalk out front.

332
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,215
呃
Oh...

333
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,120
姐妹身份对调开始了
The switch-a-Rooney was on.

334
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,955
我花了四个小时来烫头发
It took me four hours to do my hair

335
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,991
而且丽芙要让我把头晾在床外睡觉
and Liv made me sleep with my head hanging off the mattress

336
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,459
来确保不把头发给压回去了
to protect the pouf.

338
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,363
我的口水甚至流到我鼻子里了
I drooled into my own nose.

342
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,250

近日有流言说你
Are the rumors true that you,

349
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,170
一个黄毛丫头  要饰演特里斯坦·莱肯
a girl, might play Tristan Lycanth?

351
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,041
流言是真的  脑残粉
It's true, fanboy.

352
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,342
你还有意见了
What say you?

353
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,912
我的意见是这是罪恶滔天不可饶恕的
I say it's intergalactic blasphemy!

354
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,914
而我会证明你根本不值得演这个角色
And I shall prove you're unworthy.

355
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,884
注意一下  我的小喽啰们在网络直播呢

说说特里斯坦的血统吧
Speak for Tristan's lineage.

360
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:01,599
他的父母是谁
Who are his parents?

361
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:07,204
丽芙马上要出大丑啦
Liv is about to go down in flames.

我是说  真是个妙绝了的好问题啊
I mean, space-tastic question.

369
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,092

好啦  咱们可以上路了
Okay, we are good to go.

371
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,132

Does it say that?

378
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,051
我只是拍照的时候会戴眼镜的
I thought I just needed those for the picture.

380
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:57,121
给我戴上你的眼镜
Put 'em on.

381
00:16:00,258 --> 00:16:03,160
哦  天哪  我的眼睛

Now start the car and put it in gear.

我过了吗
Pass?

408
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,557
好咧  咱俩哥们
Here we are... a couple of dudes

409
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,059
要来点烧烤乐子了
getting ready to do some chillin' and grillin'.

410
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,762
我刚刚叫你哥们没问题吧
Are you okay that I just called you a dude?

411
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,664
放松放松哥们  我们是在烧烤
Relax, we're barbecuing.

412
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,367
烧烤的时候  大家都是哥们
Everybody's a dude.

413
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,669
太好了  正式行动啦
Okay. Let's do this.

414
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,538
当然咯
Absolutely.

415
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,140
不过  首先  我要你办点事儿
First, I need you to do a few things.

416
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,342
悉听尊便
Hit me. Whatever you want.

417
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,177
剥玉米  给肉入味
Shuck the corn? Season the meat?

418
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,813
修草坪
Mow the lawn.

419
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,315
呃  啥
Um, what?

420
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,684
清水管  换轮胎
And clean the gutters, rotate my tires,

421
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,220
补浴盆  还有洗碗
grout the tub, and empty the dishwasher.

422
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,122
哥们
Dude.

423
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:41,325
这些都跟烧烤八竿子打不到一块儿啊
What does that have to do with barbecuing?

424
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,093
我怎么就真以为你来我这儿是学东西的呢
I thought you came here to learn.

425
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,828
我先去修草坪
Let me go get the lawn mower.

427
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,765
我知道迪吉的伎俩
I knew exactly what Diggie was doing.

428
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,734
借烧烤之名来拉拢我这个老爸
Using barbecue to soften up the old man?

429
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,103
他要是想博得我的好感
If he wanted to get on my good side,

430
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,605
还是得先
he was going to have to get on the good side

431
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,408
过了日常家务这一关再说
of my to-do list.

432
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,344
终于  有甜头了
Finally, a little thrilla on the grilla!

433
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,147
家务活儿饿死人
All those chores made me hungry.

435
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,084
这是我的
That's mine.

436
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,521
怎么  你竟然忘记带你自己的牛排来了
What... did you forget to bring your own steak?

437
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,858
下次咯
Maybe next time.

438
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:19,863
下次
Next time?

439
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,800
我成功啦
I'm in! ( Laughs )

440
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,102
噢
Aah!

441
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,838
带你自己的牛排来  太经典了
"Bring your own steak." Classic!

442
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,143
你为什么要折磨那个可怜的孩子
Why are you messing with that poor boy?

443
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,146
只是确认一下他配不配得上咱们女儿
I'm just making sure he's good enough for my daughter.

444
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,148
真是辛苦的一天啊
And I'm done for the day.

445
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,851
别告诉玛蒂
Don't tell Maddie,

446
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,153
不过话说回来  除了他那搞笑的名字
but except for that stupid name,

447
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,189
迪吉那男孩其实不错
Diggie's all right.

448
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,794
最后一个问题
Final question, girl.

449
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,898
特里斯坦劈开宇宙太虚的时候
When Tristan split the galactic pangaea,

450
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,835
他跟那里的原住民说了什么
what did he say to the scattering colonies?

451
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,306
狼人们  迁居他星吧
"Run to the stars, wolves.

452
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,541
但是永远以你们的家人为重
But always put first your families.

453
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,876
因为  正是他们的爱
For their love

454
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,145
你们才会出现在宇宙
keeps you tethered to the universe."

455
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,716
哇  你还必须得承认
Wow. You've gotta admit...

456
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,618
玛蒂真心保住了丽芙的面子啊
Maddie's making Liv look really good.

457
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,453
她骗不了任何人
She's not fooling anyone.

458
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,456
却骗了这里的所有人
Well, except everyone here.

459
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:24,728
哇  丽芙鲁尼
Well, Liv Rooney...

460
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,930
你通过了
I'm sold.

461
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:31,568
我是说  你演特里斯坦会很棒的
I mean, you will make a great Tristan Lycanth.

462
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,706
向特里斯坦小姐致礼
All hail the she-Tristan!

464
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,878
呃  知会一声
And, FYI...

465
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,181
我舞会还没邀请别人
I currently am available for le prom.

467
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,919
但是好像你
But your window of opportunity

468
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,822
没有机会啦
is closing.

469
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,323
邦
Boop!

470
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,725
亚蒂
Artie.

471
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,527
你好好想想
Are you serious?

472
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,496
你真能接受我姐姐出演崔特里斯坦吗
You can accept my sister playing Tristan?

473
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,865
你还有什么
What part of...

474
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,333
想不通的  哈
Don't you understand?

475
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,904
这么说  帕克和我是最后
Okay, so Parker and I are the only ones

476
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,839
持干戈之矛的人咯
that have a problem with this?

477
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,474
呃  话说回来
Um, speak for yourself.

478
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,875
丽芙也得我心
She won me over too.

479
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,579
亚蒂  给我来条尾巴
Artie, tail me.

483
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,294
直到此刻  我才意识到
It was at that moment that I realized

484
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,929
我才是可能会伤害丽芙的
I was the crazy fanboy

485
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,597
那个脑残粉
that I was trying to protect Liv from.

486
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,933
我才是被家族逐弃的人
I was untethered from my family.

487
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,901
我才是离群之狼
I was the lone wolf.

488
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,239
并且  我不该吃那 15 个泡泡眼球糖的
And I should not have eaten 15 gummy eyeballs.

489
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,608
亚蒂
You know what, Artie...

490
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,977
我也要一条尾巴
tail me too.

491
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:53,517
向特里斯坦小姐致礼
All hail the she-Tristan!

493
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,026
让我把这件事情说说清楚
Let me make one thing clear.

494
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,562
你们两个这是最后一次对调身份
This was the last switch-a-Rooney.

495
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,930
你们六岁那年这么折腾过一次
You did it when you were 6.

496
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,332
然后我在你们两个额头上都
And I wrote your names on your forehead

497
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,034
拿记号笔写了你们的名字
in permanent marker.

498
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,871
你们别逼我再这么来一次
Don't make me do that again.

499
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,741
对哦  发箍之夏
Ah, yes... the summer of headbands.

500
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,611
话说回来  我们当时的发箍造型都不错呢
To be fair, though, we rocked the headband look.

502
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,947
哈  哈  有趣
Ha ha fun fun.

503
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,950
玛蒂  你 17 岁之前不允许考驾照
Maddie, no license till you're 17.

504
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,952
看你这个造型怎么拗
Rock that look.

505
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,356
17 岁  真的
17?! Seriously?

506
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,557
莫非你想等到 18 岁再说
You want to make it 18?

507
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,659
啊  17 岁啊  等不及了
Ah, 17. Looking forward to it.

508
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,795
还有  丽芙
And Liv,

509
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,429
既然你这么喜欢开车
since you like driving so much,

510
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,331
在我通知你之前你是我的私人司机
you are now my personal chauffeur until further notice.

511
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,667
- 不要啊  - 没错
- No! - Yes.

512
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,472
万事不算小  万里不称遥
There is no errand too small, no trip too far.

513
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,641
或许我只是出门拿个报纸
I might even have you take me down to the end of the driveway

514
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,909
也会要你开车载我
just to get the newspaper.

515
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,811
我不知道你们怎么看
I don't know.

516
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,480
没错  孩子们
That's right, girls.

517
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,749
我刚刚投下了一个巨型老妈弹
I just dropped an atomic mom bomb.

518
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,017
嘭
Boom!

519
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,825
她这话不当真吧
She can't be serious about that, right?

520
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,626
我们真的到现在还
Do we seriously still get newspapers

521
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,862
有订报纸上门
delivered to our house?

522
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,399
不过你在纳威店里表现不错
Hey, whatever you did down at Neville's totally worked.

523
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,035
有个叫孤狼粉丝发起了联署
Some fanboy named lone wolf started a petition

524
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,837
想要片方让我出演特里斯坦
to get me the role of Tristan.

525
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,072
你成功的说服了粉丝们
You won over the fanboys.

526
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,507
谢谢了
Thank you.

527
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,044
我能确定孤狼就是乔伊
Pretty sure lone wolf is actually lone Joey.

528
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,547
你应该去谢谢他的
You should go thank him.

529
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,015
等等  我记得你不是说乔伊
Wait, I thought you said that Joey

530
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,817
是哪个想要破坏我们的人么
was the one trying to sabotage us.

531
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,120
这事说来话长啊
It was a long and complicated day.

532
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,623
了解
Got it.

533
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,960
还有  很抱歉我搞砸了你的驾照考试
Also I'm sorry about wrecking your driver's test.

534
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,029
真的砸了  哈
Literally. Ha!

535
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,065
我给你带来了一个纪念品
And I got you something.

536
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,837
你应该把这个去还给胡佛家
You might want to return this to the... hoovers.

537
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,840
谢了
Thanks.

538
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,141
想起来了
That reminds me.

539
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,811
我也有个东西要给你
I got you something as well.

540
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,013
亚蒂的狼尾巴
One of Artie's wolf tails. Yeah.

541
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,618
哦  还有  你今年舞会有舞伴了
Oh! Also I got you a date to the prom.

542
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,987
对哦

亚蒂想知道你到时候打算穿什么
Artie would like to know what kind of dress

544
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,926
你是打算穿法师装  还是飞马装
you will be wearing... Wizard or Pegasus?

546
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,935
丽芙  你这话可没错
Liv, you were absolutely right.

547
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,937
我从来没想到这么坐在副驾驶座
It is mind-blowing what I can accomplish

548
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,906
我能完成多少事情
from the passenger seat of the car.

549
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,008
我付了账单  订了几件漂亮衣服
I paid a bill, ordered some cute tops,

550
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,576
领养了只企鹅

00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,113
