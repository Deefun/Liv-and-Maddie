1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:07,773
怎么回事  为什么这里这么冷
Is it just me, or is it really cold in here?

2
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:09,508
既然如此  何妨你再套件衣服呢
Well, here. Why don't you wear this?

3
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,278
你的队服
Your letterman jacket?

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,180
是啊  哦
Yeah. Oh.

5
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,282
你不是说你觉得有点冷么
You said you were cold.

6
00:00:17,284 --> 00:00:19,818
是啊
I did. I am.

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:22,521
呃  有点冷
Brr. Cold.

8
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,525
一会见了  鲁尼
Well, later, Rooney.

9
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:38,103
我那双闪亮的
Do my crystal-clear

10
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:39,805
绿色大眼睛没有骗我吧
Emerald-green eyes deceive me

11
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:42,307
迪吉把他的队服给你了
Or did Diggie just give you his letterman jacket?

12
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:45,778
恭喜啦
con-graz-ulations.

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,279
好吧  淡定  丽芙
Okay, simmer down, Liv.

14
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,648
我只是觉得有点冷  这又没什么
I was just cold. It doesn't mean anything.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,117
他这不是明摆着喜欢你么
It's so obvi he likes you, Maddie.

16
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:55,254
我知道他喜欢我  不过你觉得他真的这么喜欢我么
I know he likes me, but do you think he like like likes me?

17
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,990
我想我应该知道  但我到底该怎么才能完全知道
I think I know, but how do I like know know?

18
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,727
他这不是把它的外套给你了么
Well, he gave you his coat coat.

19
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:06,131
或许你劈头盖脸的
Maybe he's just confused as to how you feel

20
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,933
“别来无恙”“有点事”
With all the "s'ups" and the "stuffs"

21
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:10,335
和“哈  怎样”让他看不清他对你的感情
And the "bam whats" flying at him.

22
00:01:10,337 --> 00:01:14,106
他能坚持这么久不离你而去已经算是一个奇迹了
It's honestly amazing that he stuck around this long.

23
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,974
你早该告诉他你喜欢他了
Just tell him you like him already.

24
00:01:15,976 --> 00:01:17,242
丽芙 我不知道
I don't know, Liv.

25
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:19,311
我觉得我和迪吉这样并无大碍啊
I think Diggie and I are fine the way we are.

26
00:01:19,313 --> 00:01:20,779
你怎么会觉得每当我和迪吉面对面气氛都
I mean, you're acting like every time we see each other

27
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,614
尴尬异常啊
It's completely awkward.

28
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,283
嘿  鲁尼
Hey, Rooney.

29
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:29,988
我的皮夹还在这件衣服的口袋里
Just forgot my wallet in my jacket.

30
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,793
这
Oh.

31
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,232
给你
Here you go.

32
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,134
谢了
Thank you.

33
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,602

34
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,970
哈  怎样
Bam, what?

35
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:49,241
你觉得他“有点事”该怎么理解
So what do you think he meant by "stuff"?

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,379
最好的朋友
Better in stereo

37
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:56,715
不同的朋友
B— b-- better in stereo

38
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,750
迎着清晨阳光
- I'm up with the sunshine -let's go

39
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,853
穿上舒服衣裳

40
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,222
扣篮  热热身

准备下一场较量
I dare you, come on and follow

00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,697
你有你的节拍

我的歌声嘹亮
I'll sing the melody

46
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:16,101
你想接受
when you say yea-ah-ah

47
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,769
我却摇头
I say no-oh-oh

48
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,371
你想停留
when you say stop

49
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,274
我却一心只想  走走走
all I want to do is go, go, go

50
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:25,777
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the other half of me, me

学不来的朋友

00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:31,250
截然不同的朋友
the half that drives me crazy

53
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,353
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the better half of me, me

54
00:02:34,355 --> 00:02:36,722
离不开的朋友
the half I'll always need

00:02:36,724 --> 00:02:38,390
你我有

56
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:40,425
不或缺的朋友

我多少也算是个大人物
I'm kind of a big deal.

76
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:37,416
该被嘲笑的是你吧  亚蒂
The burn is on you, Artie.

宅男们都管它叫“应用”

酷  你安装了面对面聊天的应用

用来视频对话的
I use it with all my friends.

95
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,285
除了西蒙  他一般都在挖鼻孔
Except simon. He picks his nose,

96
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,387
我可不需要看那么仔细
And I don't need to see that up close.

希望她不要发觉这是你

100
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:56,828
然后就会拒绝接听
And decide not to answer.

101
00:04:59,033 --> 00:05:00,032
你好
Hello?

102
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,867
噢  你好  丽芙

104
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,804
猜猜我是在哪里跟你聊天呢
Guess where I'm calling you from?

105
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,174
我就猜是厨房吧
I'm going to go with kitchen,

106
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:10,309
因为我看得到你
Because I can see you...

107
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,910
坐在厨房里
Sitting in the kitchen.

108
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,446
嘿  你床边那个不是我们的
Hey. Is that our hip-hop sno-cone maker

109
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,847
说唱兼果味冰淇淋机么
Beside your bed?

110
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,850
呃  什么冰淇淋机来着
Uh, what sno-cone maker?

111
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:19,985
哪来的床
What bed?

112
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,520
你到底是谁
Who are you?

113
00:05:23,523 --> 00:05:26,458
她们敢偷我们的冰淇淋机  吃了豹子胆吧
How dare they steal our sno-cone maker?

114
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,394
我们快去把“臭蛋阵风”救出来吧
Let's go rescue the notorious s.N.O.

115
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,166
亲爱的 除虫师告诉我了个坏消息
Bad news from the exterminator, hon.

116
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:37,169
我们家有不少名叫食木粉蠹的甲虫
We've got wood-eating powder post beetles.

117
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:40,272
噢  我奶奶的老房子有这家伙
Oh. My grandmother had those in her old house.

118
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:41,340
我从来没见过那个房子啊
I never saw that house.

119
00:05:41,342 --> 00:05:43,408
正是如此
Exactly.

120
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,377
除虫师需要来彻底清查我们的房子
They need to tent our place.

121
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:48,180
我们得把不想沾上杀虫剂的东西都打包
We've got to pack up anything we don't want pesticide on

122
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,348
这个周末搬出去住
And clear out for the weekend.

123
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,949
哦
Ooh.

124
00:05:50,951 --> 00:05:54,286
我想去麦迪逊度假直至整个周末结束
I'm thinking a last minute weekend getaway to madison

125
00:05:54,288 --> 00:05:55,454
因此我们就可以游泳  购物
So we can swim, shop,

126
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,189
玩乐  血拼还有大采购
Play, shop and shop.

127
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:59,057
但是
But...

128
00:05:59,059 --> 00:06:01,460
这个计划必须保密
This has to be a secret.

129
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:03,228
一旦丽芙发现了我们房子里有虫子
If Liv finds out we have bugs,

130
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,163
她就会吓疯的
She will freak out.

131
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:07,432
丽芙对虫子可是恐惧至极
Oh, Liv has an irrational fear of bugs.

132
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,168
当她还很小的时候  我给她读了《夏洛的网》
When she was little, I read her the first three pages

133
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:13,305
开头三页  然后她昏过去了
Of "charlotte's web" and she passed out.

134
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,240
上周  丽芙正在洗澡
Last week, Liv was in the shower.

135
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,442
她看见了一只瓢虫
She saw a ladybug and...

136
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:19,177
结果这事就发生了
This happened.

137
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,645
后来发现那不是一只瓢虫
Turns out it wasn't a ladybug.

138
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,981
那只是软糖豆
It was a jelly bean.

139
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:24,449
我从来都不知道我头发里有什么
I never know what's in my hair

140
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:25,650
直到我彻底洗一遍
Until I rinse it out.

141
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,256
唔  橘子味的
Ooh, tangerine.

142
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:34,192
所以我要上网
So I'm gonna go on the internet

143
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,594
给咱们预订酒店房间
And make us a hotel reservation

144
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:39,197
这就要用到我炫酷的新手机  真是步入未来了啊
With my fab new phone. The future is now.

145
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,400
啊呀呀  我不喜欢未来
Oh, I don't like the future.

146
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,305
我们看到冰淇淋机了  交出来
We saw the sno-cone maker. Hand it over.

147
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,040
你们是不会找到的
you'll never find it.

148
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:51,343
我找到了
I found it.

149
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,379
柠檬 椰子
lemon, coconut

150
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,148
草莓 酸橙
strawberry, lime

151
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,184
你做冰淇淋我唱歌
you make a sno-cone while I rhyme

152
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,318
吼  吼  吼  吼
ho ho ho ho

153
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,687
谁想来点果味冰淇淋
who wants a sno-cone?

154
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,292
现在你们明白为啥我们要把它藏起来了吧
And you wonder why we hid it from you.

155
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,663
喔 老妈又想视频聊天
Oh, it's mom facegabbing again.

156
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:14,399
她也许是一不小心拨了我的号
She probably doesn't even know she called me.

157
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,201
能离开这房子真是太激动了
I'm kind of excited to get out of this house.

158
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:17,569
我早已准备好改头换面了
I'm so ready for a change.

159
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:20,005
- 离开这房子  - 嘘
- Out of the house? - Shh.

160
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,273
调成静音
and mute.

161
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:23,341
现在我们听得到他们  而他们听不到我们
Now we can hear them, but they can't hear us.

162
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,211
“改头换面”是什么意思
What does "ready for a change" mean?

163
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,180
这不是很明显么  他们想赶你走
Isn't it obvious? They want to get rid of you.

164
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:29,448
嘘
Shh.

165
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,451
把所有东西打包
This is such a pain to pack everything up

166
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:34,453
再搬出房子真是痛苦啊
And move out of the house.

167
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,322
听起来像是他们卖了房子带我们搬家
It sounds like they sold the house and we're moving.

168
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,624
搬家  不不不  这肯定不对劲
Moving? No, that can't be right.

169
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,159
我知道孩子们会抱怨
I know the kids are gonna complain

170
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,327
离开他们的伙伴们
About missing their friends,

171
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:43,995
但是他们会喜欢上麦迪逊的
But they're gonna love madison.

172
00:07:43,997 --> 00:07:45,330
麦迪逊
Madison?!

173
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,665
麦迪逊可是两小时车程以外的地方
Madison's two hours from here.

174
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,400
我们要进完全不同的一个学校
That's a completely different school

175
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:50,368
没有迪吉在里边
With no Diggies in it.

176
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:55,273
明天 4 点我们要带上行李离开这儿
We have to be packed up and out of here by 4:00 tomorrow.

177
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:57,008
明天
Tomorrow?!

178
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,744
他们怎么可能搬家了还不告诉我们？
How could they not tell us we're moving?

179
00:07:59,746 --> 00:08:01,413
哇哦
Wow.

180
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:04,082
明天就是我们在斯蒂文角的最后一天了
Tomorrow's our last day in Stevens Point.

181
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:05,484
不可理喻
Unacceptable.

182
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:06,751
妈  爸
Mom, dad,

183
00:08:06,753 --> 00:08:08,487
我们听到了
We heard you.

184
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:09,454
哪儿来的声音？
What's that noise?

185
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:10,655
是你的孩子们
It's your children.

186
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,424
就是关于麦迪逊你还没咨询那群人
The ones you didn't consult about madison.

187
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,525
哦
Oh.

188
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:15,293
手机还开着
the phone was on?

189
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,295
破软件
Stupid a.P.P.S

190
00:08:17,297 --> 00:08:20,332
孩子们  我们怕你们若听到消息
Guys, we thought you'd freak out less

191
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:22,467
都会精神崩溃的
If we surprised you with the news.

192
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:23,668
那么  我们现在崩溃了
Well, we're freaking.

193
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,370
你必须把这计划取消了
You have to call this off.

194
00:08:25,372 --> 00:08:27,405
抱歉  该付的都已经付了
Sorry. Everything's paid for.

195
00:08:27,407 --> 00:08:29,608
我们刚达成了一个完美的协议
We just got a really sweet deal.

196
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,377
这实在太过分了
This is an outrage.

197
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:34,713
把泳衣也带上  那里有个游泳池哦
Pack your swimsuits. There's a pool.

198
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:36,781
唔  作为墙头草  我改支持他们了
Ooh, game changer. I'm in.

199
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,688
天啊
Wow.

200
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,224
我们这是真的要搬家了
We are really moving.

201
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:47,759
是啊  这是我们在这里的最后一天
Yep, it's our last day here.

202
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:55,534
咋了  这又不是我们的问题
What? It's somebody else's problem now.

203
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,170
我可不会坐在这把椅子上面
I wouldn't sit in that chair either.

204
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,343
好吧  我今天得有所作为
Well, I'm making today count.

205
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:07,212
我在转学之前打败亚蒂
I'm gonna take Artie down and leave the school

206
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,348
我想当无可非议的火箭大王
The undisputed rocket king.

207
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,483
祝你好运  熊孩子
Way to go, munch.

208
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,218
能被你激发灵感的人
You're an inspiration...

209
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,653
根本没有
To no one.

210
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,221
好吧
Okay.

211
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:18,456
今天是我们住在这里的最后一天了  你打算干什么
So what are you doing with your last day?

212
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,359
我还有一些事情要做
I've got a few loose ends to tie up.

213
00:09:21,361 --> 00:09:23,194
你知道的越少越好
The less you know, the better.

214
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,232
或许我拉粑粑不关门
I might poop with the door open,

215
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:29,501
但是我还是有我自己的秘密
But I still have my secrets.

216
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:33,204
我一宿没睡  做了一个新的火箭
I stayed up all night building a brand-new rocket.

217
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:35,407
它很完美
It's perfect--

218
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,677
就连在舷窗里面挥手的外星人都有
Right down to the decal of the aliens waving in the windows.

219
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,744
各位好啊
Hi, guys.

220
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:42,681
如果今天是我在这里的最后一天
If I only have one day left here,

221
00:09:42,683 --> 00:09:44,683
我得必须向迪吉表白了
I'm gonna tell Diggie how I feel about him.

222
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,551
我得直接看向他那双漂亮的
I'm going to stare right into those

223
00:09:46,553 --> 00:09:48,353
棕色眼睛  说
Beautiful brown eyes and say

224
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,089
“迪吉  别来无恙”
“Diggie, s'up?"

225
00:09:55,494 --> 00:09:57,362
我在这里的最后一天  我要想方设法说服我妈
For my last day, I'm gonna convince mom

226
00:09:57,364 --> 00:09:58,763
我身体不舒服  想晚些走
That I'm sick so I can stay behind

227
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:00,365
和我儿时所住的地方告别
And say good-bye to my childhood home.

228
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,704
53 度
126.8.

229
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:07,238
我能活着已经是奇迹了
I'm lucky to be alive.

230
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,511
这就是不能在太空中用牙线的原因
And that's why you never floss in space.

231
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,314
好好想想
Think about it.

232
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:25,457
火箭爱好者们
Rocketeers,

233
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,325
大饱眼福吧
Feast your eyes

234
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:28,793
看看我的新火箭
On my new rocket.

235
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:32,497
名叫“亚蒂是怂包”
The "Artie is a wad-bag."

236
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,634
你不能给你的火箭这样命名
You can't call your rocket that.

237
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:38,703
那好  我已经做了不少火箭  亚蒂
Well, I've made a lot of rockets, Artie.

238
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,839
你能把它的名字大声说出来
Could you say the name out loud

239
00:10:40,841 --> 00:10:42,507
好让我知道你在说哪一个么？
So I know which one you're talking about?

240
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,709
问得好
Nice try.

241
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:46,645
但你当我是傻瓜么
But do you take me for a fool?

242
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:49,481
不  我当你是怂包
No. I take you for a wad-bag.

243
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,717
是时候决出谁是火箭大王了
It's time we settle who the rocket king is

244
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,386
一劳永逸
Once and for all.

245
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:56,721
大声宣布你的挑战吧
Speak forth your challenge!

246
00:10:56,723 --> 00:11:00,392
我现在就宣布
I'm speaking forth, baby.

247
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:02,694
鹰式 500 型
The falcon 500

248
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:04,496
对决“亚蒂是怂包”
Versus "Artie is a wad-bag"

249
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:07,232
走廊火箭对决赛
In a hallway rocket chair race.

250
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:10,301
我接受你的挑战
I accept your challenge.

251
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:14,305
等等  我们什么时候开始比赛
Wait, when are we doing this again?

252
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,440
我今天计划都快排满了
I'm a little overscheduled today.

253
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:16,841
3 点整怎么样
Like 3:00?

254
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,376
3 点半行吗
Does 3:30 work?

255
00:11:18,378 --> 00:11:19,444
3 点半  喷泉边上见
3:30 by the water fountain.

256
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:22,213
- 是粘了口香糖的那个还是能工作的那个  -当然是能工作的那个了
- Or the one that works? - The one that works, duh.

257
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,548
- 但我刚才不知道啊  - 那么你现在知道了
- Well, I didn't know. - Well, now you do.

258
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,350
- 好吧  接受你的挑战  - 太好了
- Fine. Challenge accepted. - Great.

259
00:11:27,553 --> 00:11:29,721
别了 亲爱的老房子
Goodbye, old house.

260
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,456
我们还并未互相重新了解
We just barely got to know each other again

261
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,625
就又被拆开了
And now we're torn apart.

262
00:11:33,627 --> 00:11:35,326
沙发 你可能安抚我受伤的心灵
Will you comfort me, couch,

263
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,295
您这午后之梦
Collector of afternoon dreams

264
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,496
和零碎硬币的载体
And loose change?

265
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,237
老妈又要视频对话
facegabbing again, mom?

266
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,542
嘿 皮特 我是抱抱熊啊
Hey, pete. It's care bear.

267
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,244
我刚看到你经过走廊
I just saw you walk down the hall.

268
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,380
你那新牛仔裤看起来帅呆了
Those new jeans are looking good.

269
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,554
看来我不用装就已经病了
And now I don't have to pretend to be sick.

270
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,326
吾去也  彩色玻璃窗
Oh. Au revoir, stained glass window.

271
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:09,928
你让我的生活丰富多彩
You colored my world.

272
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,995
我还记得当我
I remember when I was--

273
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:18,369
帕克  你在这儿干嘛
Parker, what are you doing?

274
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,271
我在填我的隧道
I'm filling in my tunnels.

275
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:24,442
好吧  也许我该更具体一些
Okay, perhaps I should have been more specific.

276
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:25,610
什么
What?!

277
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,646
我在房子内部挖了一个
I've been digging an intricate

278
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,315
错综复杂的隧道网
Network of tunnels around the house.

279
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,383
起初  这只不过是用作逃离单调乏味的
At first, it was an escape from the monotony

280
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,451
每日生活
Of everyday life,

281
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:35,320
但最后就变成了个真实的逃离口
But then it became an actual escape

282
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:36,554
防患于未然嘛
In case stuff got real.

283
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:42,460
你在里面弄了一些神神秘秘的小玩意  对不
You've got a serious party going on up there, don't you?

284
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,596
嘿  幸亏这些隧道
Hey, thanks to these tunnels,

285
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,264
我可以只花三步
I can get from my bedroom

286
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,533
就从卧室跑到卫生间
To the bathroom in three steps.

287
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,468
- 哦  - 有时
- Oh. - Sometimes,

288
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,970
分秒必争
Every second counts.

289
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,612
我决定我应该给迪吉留张字条
I decided I should write Diggie a note,

290
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,413
但我想做点有纪念意义的事
But I wanted to do something memorable.

291
00:13:02,415 --> 00:13:04,115
之前他把他的篮球落在了我家
And he left his basketball at my house,

292
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,917
所以我决定还给他
So I returned it

293
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,586
上面留了言  我喜欢你 - 麦蒂
With the words "I like you. - Maddie"

294
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:11,055
是笔写在上边的
Written on it.

295
00:13:11,057 --> 00:13:12,524
咋了
What?

296
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:14,392
这是“疯狗鲁尼”最甜蜜的举动了
That's as sweet as mad dog Rooney gets.

297
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:17,662
呼  我得洗个澡  伙计们
Whoo! I gotta shower, guys.

298
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,063
我已经汗流浃背了
I'm sweating like a pig.

299
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:20,331
待会见  好不
I'll see you later, all right?

300
00:13:25,404 --> 00:13:28,773
噢  麦蒂把篮球还给我了
Oh hey, Maddie returned my basketball.

301
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,074
很好
Okay.

302
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,409
他正在读留言
He's reading it.

303
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,581
哦天啊  她把球弄得脏兮兮的
Oh man, she got it all dirty.

304
00:13:40,553 --> 00:13:42,420
别来无恙  迪吉
S'up, Diggie.

305
00:13:42,422 --> 00:13:44,422
噢  嘿  鲁尼
Oh, hey, Rooney.

306
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,391
那啥
So,

307
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,059
我把篮球还给你了
I returned your basketball.

308
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,060
你看见上面有什么了没
Did you see what was on it?

309
00:13:49,062 --> 00:13:50,528
哦  那些黑渍啊
Oh, that?

310
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,630
管他呢
Who cares?

311
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
什么
What?

312
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,534
对啊  没什么大不了的
Yeah, whatever.

313
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,569
又不是什么大事
It's not a big deal.

314
00:13:59,405 --> 00:14:00,471
不是什么大事
Not a big deal?

315
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,575
对于我来说这算是最重要的事了
To me this was like the biggest deal ever.

316
00:14:03,577 --> 00:14:05,643
好吧  跟你说
Yeah, you know what?

317
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,579
这彻头彻尾就是个错误
This was a mistake.

318
00:14:10,082 --> 00:14:12,650
天啊  刚才发生了什么
Wow. What was that all about?

319
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,587
咋地  我就在走廊里自言自语
Yeah, I'm talking to myself in the hall.

320
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,689
刚才被妹子弄晕了  你爬开
Baffling girl moment. Move on.

332
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:28,433
听好了
All right.

333
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:30,068
绕大厅一周
Once around the hall.

334
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:32,770
胜者将永远被尊为
Winner is declared now and forever

335
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,405
火箭大王
The rocket king.

336
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,640
呼啦
Holla!

337
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,611
而输家将被贬为乔伊
And the loser is declared joey.

338
00:14:39,613 --> 00:14:41,012
啊哈
Burn!

339
00:14:42,014 --> 00:14:43,414
嘿  我们再添点赌注
Hey, how about we make things

340
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,083
让游戏更有趣怎么样？
Even more interesting?

341
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:46,751
允许胜者
Let's say the winner

342
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,420
公开羞辱输家
Gets to publicly humiliate the loser

343
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,556
整整一周
For an entire week?

344
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,825
他就自己乐去吧  不论输赢
Joke's on him because, win or lose,

345
00:14:53,827 --> 00:14:55,894
下周我都在麦迪逊了
Next week I'll be in madison.

346
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:57,629
未来真美好
Future burn.

347
00:14:59,431 --> 00:15:01,065
对的  明天他就会感觉到了
Yeah, he'll feel that one tomorrow.

348
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:05,169
就等着吃我的尾气吧
Get ready to eat my exhaust.

349
00:15:05,171 --> 00:15:07,171
你永远抓不到猎鹰
You'll never catch the falcon.

351
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,410
你永远抓不住怂包
You'll never catch the wad-bag.

353
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,082
这就是怂包发出的声音
That's the sound a wad-bag makes.

354
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:19,550
哦  对了
Oh, wait.

355
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,753
你早就知道了怂包怎么叫了
You already knew that.

356
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,498
为啥今天你家人都这么不正常
Why is everyone in your family acting so weird today?

357
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,833
今晚鲁尼全家就要搬去麦迪逊了
The rooneys are moving to madison tonight.

358
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,735
你们搬家了  什么
You're moving? What?

359
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:38,836
对啊  我知道
Yeah, I know.

360
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,438
我也挺难接受的
I took it pretty hard myself.

361
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,040
但是既来之则安之嘛  迪吉
But you have to embrace it, Diggie.

362
00:15:42,042 --> 00:15:44,442
不管怎样  如果万事都不改变
After all, if nothing ever changed,

363
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,077
就不会有纷飞的蝴蝶了
There would be no butterflies.

364
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,614
哥们  我也会想你的
Yeah, I'll miss you too, buddy.

365
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:55,553
好戏就要开场了
Let's light this candle.

368
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,122
当我看到其他的火箭爱好者
As I looked at my fellow rocketeers,

369
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:32,523
我意识到
I realized

370
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,958
一旦我成为了火箭大王
If I became rocket king

371
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,094
次日又离开
And left the next day,

372
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,228
要让谁来领导他们
Who would lead them?

373
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,764
我不得不让亚蒂胜出
I had to let Artie win.

374
00:16:39,766 --> 00:16:41,566
他尽管是我的死对头
He was my nemesis,

375
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:44,502
但他也是社团最大的希望
But he was also the club's best hope.

377
00:16:50,276 --> 00:16:52,010
喔！
Ooh!

378
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,780
输掉了比赛也摧毁了荣耀
Losing the race bruised my pride.

379
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:59,250
撞上了台阶也摧毁了我的肩膀
Smashing into the stairs bruised my shoulder,

380
00:16:59,252 --> 00:17:01,185
我的膝盖
My knees

381
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:02,587
和我的腰子
And my kidney.

383
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,062
耶  万岁
Yeah! Whoo!

384
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,196
我赢了
I won.

385
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:15,600
我是火箭大王
I am the rocket king.

386
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:19,237
好好领导他们 怂包
Lead them well, wad-bag.

387
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,638
别辜负了我
Lead them well.

388
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,607
万岁  耶
Whoo! Yeah!

378
00:17:27,013 --> 00:17:32,116
Were you just gonna move away without saying goodbye?

379
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:34,052
Well, I was gonna tell you,

380
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,253
But then I got really hurt

381
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,255
When you blew me off after reading my note.

382
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:40,258
The one that I wrote on the basketball,

383
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,193
Like one does when one is terrified

384
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,194
Of getting hurt,

385
00:17:43,196 --> 00:17:44,729
Like one did.

386
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:51,769
I must have smudged it with my basketball pig sweat.

387
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,771
What did it say?

388
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,609
I like you, Diggie.

389
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,213
I like you too, Maddie.

390
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:04,315
( chuckles )

391
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,783
Coming through, people.

392
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,319
Tunnels don't fill themselves.

393
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:11,789
Ignore him. Stay focused.

394
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,791
Okay.

395
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,793
If you're moving,

396
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:17,261
I want you to have this.

397
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:20,898
And not because you're cold.

398
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,266
But because...

399
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,969
This means something to me.

400
00:18:25,904 --> 00:18:27,772
Like you do.

401
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,646
Diggie!

402
00:18:39,651 --> 00:18:42,120
I knew you'd come by.

403
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,788
Couldn't let your best pal leave town

404
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,623
Without saying goodbye, huh?

405
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,259
( clears throat )

406
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:50,261
( sighs )

407
00:18:50,263 --> 00:18:52,196
I really like you, man.

408
00:18:57,836 --> 00:18:59,804
Oh.

409
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,974
爸妈用来记录我们身高的门框
The doorjamb where mom and dad marked our heights.

410
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:04,475
我一直比玛蒂高一点点
I was always an eighth of an inch taller than Maddie,

411
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,411
那不算什么  但意义重大
Not that it matters... But it does.

412
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,915
听着
Listen up!

413
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,384
我们有重大消息要宣布
We have some big news.

414
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,987
玛蒂和迪吉正式
Maddie and Diggie are officially

415
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,054
承认互相喜欢对方
In like with each other.

416
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,823
你们俩总算告白啦
Finally.

417
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,391
玛吉配成真啦
The birth of Miggie.

418
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:22,994
呵  你别这样
Yeah, don't do that.

419
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,795
其实我有点喜欢这种称呼的
Aw, I kind of like it.

420
00:19:24,797 --> 00:19:26,797
我不喜欢
I hate it.

422
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:30,067
你们俩成一对我其实很开心
I'm so glad you guys are finally together.

423
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,671
我受够了
This is too much.

424
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,006
我们不能搬家啊
I mean, we can't leave.

425
00:19:35,008 --> 00:19:36,874
我们一辈子都住在这里的啊
Our entire lives are here.

426
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,343
我才不管爸妈的意见
I don't care what mom and dad say.

427
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:42,280
我就赖着不走了
I am staging a live-in.

428
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,381
谁愿意和我一起
Who's with me?

429
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,187
嘿  孩子们
Hey, kids.

430
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,027
看来你们都整理好行李了
So I see you guys have packed.

431
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,029
我们才不会让你们卖掉房子
We are not letting you sell the house

432
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,230
搬家去麦迪逊的
And move us to madison.

433
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,431
卖掉房子
Sell the house?

434
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,300
这是哪门子空穴来风
Where on earth did you get that idea?

435
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:04,001
还不是你们两个和我们打的可视电话
From when you facegabbed us.

436
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:05,870
我们听见你们两个的整个邪恶计划了
We heard your whole devious plan.

437
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,139
是啊
Yeah.

438
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:09,807
我还听见你评论老爸的新裤子
And I heard you talking about dad's new pants.

439
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:12,410
恶心
Gross!

440
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:17,348
你们这个老爸只要穿得稍微想点样子
When your father looks even remotely fashionable

441
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,283
我就得鼓励鼓励他
I have to encourage that.

442
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,819
是啊
It's true.

443
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,387
就像训练海狮那样
It's like training a seal.

444
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:26,157
其次
And second of all,

445
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,291
我不知道你们从可视电话
I don't know what you think you heard

446
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,826
都听见了些什么
On facegab,

447
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,161
我们不是要搬家去麦迪逊
But we are not moving to madison.

448
00:20:30,163 --> 00:20:31,796
只是去度个周末
We're just going there for the weekend.

449
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,366
你的意思是说我白白的把我挖的隧道填了
You mean I filled in my tunnels for nothing?

450
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,069
隧道
Tunnels?

451
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,938
这下麻烦大了
Stuff just got real.

453
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,379
且慢
Wait.

454
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,414
照此说来我下周一还是得去学校
You're saying I have to go to school with Artie

455
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,350
和亚蒂抬头不见低头见的
On Monday?

456
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,153
我这就上楼整理行李去麦迪逊
I will be upstairs packing for madison...

457
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:57,822
然后闷头痛哭
And crying.

458
00:20:57,824 --> 00:20:59,290
主要是闷头痛哭
Mostly crying.

459
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,928
你们干什么要把这一次旅行搞得这么神秘
Why were you keeping this trip such a secret?

460
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,298
好吧  我们还是把事情讲明了
All right. Might as well come clean.

461
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,767
除害专家要来熏一下我们家
Exterminators are tenting our house.

462
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:11,469
我们家有蛀虫
We're infested with beetles.

463
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,137
家里有虫子
Bugs?

464
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:21,245
等等  你们不能把那些虫子打掉
Wait. You can't exterminate the beetles.

465
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:25,416
那是我花了无数时间养出来的
I spent forever breeding those suckers.

466
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:28,953
你是这整件事的始作俑者
This whole thing is your fault?

467
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,821
别怪我  怪那些虫子
Don't blame me. Blame the beetles.

468
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,291
我这就去和它们好好谈谈
You know what? I'm gonna go have a word with them.

469
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,961
你赶紧给我从这个洞里面出来
Get out of that hole right now.

470
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,164
年轻人  我们得谈谈
We need to talk, young man!

471
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,499
我知道你在里面
We know you're in there.

472
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,369
我这就进来了
I'm going in.

473
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,310
哇
Wow.

474
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:53,811
既然如此
So...

475
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,513
看来你还是住在这里
Looks like you're staying.

476
00:21:58,183 --> 00:21:59,417
我们两个有了这么一番对话
