250
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:40,879
有谁看见玛蒂了么
Has anybody seen Maddie?

251
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:42,747
比赛还有两分钟就开始了
Our game starts in two minutes.

252
00:11:42,765 --> 00:11:43,882
玛蒂还没有来
Maddie's not here?

253
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:45,684
她可从来没有缺席过一场比赛的啊
She's never missed a game.

254
00:11:45,718 --> 00:11:48,053
等等  要是玛蒂没有来  我就得上场了啊
Wait, if Maddie doesn't show, that means I have to play.

255
00:11:48,087 --> 00:11:49,921
这可不能这样啊  天
That can't happen, man.

256
00:11:51,608 --> 00:11:53,758
我本来还打算在比赛的时候把作业写了呢
During the game is when I get my homework done.

257
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:57,946
玛蒂今天表现的很是奇怪啊
Maddie was acting really weird today.

258
00:11:57,981 --> 00:12:00,899
她是不是长高了
And did she get taller?

259
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:02,784
长高了
Taller?

260
00:12:02,819 --> 00:12:05,570
大概长高了多少  是不是 7 公分左右
Like how much taller? Like 2 1/2 inches taller?

261
00:12:05,604 --> 00:12:06,705
差不多吧
Yeah, something like that.

262
00:12:06,739 --> 00:12:08,740
她看上去变了个人似的
She just seemed different.

263
00:12:08,774 --> 00:12:11,543
她居然在那咯咯笑  玛蒂才不会这么笑
She giggled. Maddie doesn't giggle.

264
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:12,744
她一直都是哼哼的
She snorts.

265
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:17,582
她今天整个感觉都像是由内而外透出某种光芒似的
It's like she had some kind of inner sparkle, man.

267
00:12:18,784 --> 00:12:19,885
鞋子
The shoes.

268
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,671
我想我应该知道她在哪里了
Um, I think I know where she might be.

269
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,973
我这就去叫她
So I will just go get her.

270
00:12:25,008 --> 00:12:26,758
嗯
Yeah.

271
00:12:26,792 --> 00:12:28,560
你看看能不能把表演拖一会
See if you can get them to hold curtain.

272
00:12:29,896 --> 00:12:32,630
天  这姑娘真心不了解运动啊
Wow, that girl really doesn't get sports.

273
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:34,799
好吧  小污点  该你上场了
All right, stains. You're in.

274
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,685
好吧
Fine.

275
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,692
我又不知道今天要我上场
I didn't think I was going to play today.
