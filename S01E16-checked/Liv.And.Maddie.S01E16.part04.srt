111
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:21,797
C+
C-plus?
 
112
00:05:21,832 --> 00:05:24,450
还是体育
In gym?
 
113
00:05:26,753 --> 00:05:27,837
爸
Dad.
 
114
00:05:27,888 --> 00:05:32,641
哈  亲爱的戴个哨子的父亲大人
Ha! Loving father man who wears the whistle.
 
115
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:37,763
如果你不能让我的平均分变得好看些  我就永远都致不了毕业辞了
If I don't keep my perfect G.P.A., I will never be valedictorian.
 
116
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:42,818
而且我在机器人社里牛皮吹得老大
And I have been talking a lot of smack in robotics club.
 
117
00:05:42,853 --> 00:05:45,654
所以还造了个会吹牛大吹特吹的机器人
So has the smack-talking robot I built.
 
118
00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:48,774
抱歉了  儿子  但是我必须要给你打低分
Sorry, son, but I had to mark you down
 
119
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:52,478
因为你没能在 35 秒内完成折返跑
because you didn't finish your shuttle run in under 35 seconds.
 
120
00:05:52,496 --> 00:05:56,582
35 秒  爸爸  那是不可能的
35 seconds? Daddy, that's impossible.
 
121
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:57,816
噢  是吗
Oh, yeah?
 
122
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,752
嘿  迪吉
Hey, Diggie.
 
123
00:05:59,786 --> 00:06:01,454
你跑一趟折返跑看看
We're go for shuttle run.
 
124
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:05,758
现在开始计时
Timer starts now.
 
125
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:07,626
如果你想要的话  可以让你重考
If you want, I can give you a retest,
 
126
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,495
但你只能有一次机会
but you're only going to get one shot at it.
 
127
00:06:09,513 --> 00:06:12,631
你的意思是我唯一能保证毕业的方法
You're telling me the only way I'm going to be valedictorian
 
128
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:16,435
就是像只蟑螂一样发疯的在体育馆里来回跑
is if I scurry across the gym floor like a jock-roach.
 
129
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,887
我又不是定规则的人  孩子
I don't make the rules, son.
 
130
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:19,522
我只是负责吹哨的
I just blow the whistle.
 
131
00:06:19,556 --> 00:06:21,673
同时  我还教你们生理课
Also, I teach health class.
 
132
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:23,859
所以一旦你们对自己青春期的变化有什么疑问
So if you have any questions about your changing body,
 
133
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:25,844
我的门随时为你们敞开
my door is always open.
 
134
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:29,698
算了吧  还是把门关了得了
Yeah, let's keep that door closed.
 
135
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,450
完成了
Done!
 
136
00:06:31,485 --> 00:06:32,684
折返跑跑得不错啊  迪吉
Nice shuttle run, Diggie.
 
137
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:35,654
28.7 秒
28.7 seconds.
 
138
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,573
我认为这是最好成绩了  孩子
I don't think any less of you, son.
 
139
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,710
嘿
Hey!
 
140
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,695
迪吉
Diggie.
 
141
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,748
我最爱的校队运动员
My favorite varsity athlete
 
142
00:06:45,799 --> 00:06:50,553
也是唯一一个从不打击贬低我的家伙
and the only one who has never purpled my nurples.
 
143
00:06:50,587 --> 00:06:51,703
我需要你帮个忙
I need a favor.
 
144
00:06:51,721 --> 00:06:54,473
我必须在 35 秒内跑完折返跑
I need to do the shuttle run in under 35 seconds.
 
145
00:06:54,508 --> 00:06:55,591
哦  你想让我来训练你
Oh, so you want me to train you?
 
146
00:06:55,642 --> 00:06:59,812
- 我很乐意  - 其实  我想让你当枪手来替我跑
- I'd be happy to. - Actually, I was thinking you'd do it for me.
 
147
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,647
我给你戴副眼镜
I'd give you some glasses.
 
148
00:07:01,681 --> 00:07:02,815
穿上古怪的筒形袜
Some fancy tube socks.
 
149
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:07,403
乔伊  无意冒犯  但是没人会认为我就是你的
Joey, no offense, but no one's going to believe that I'm you.
 
150
00:07:07,437 --> 00:07:09,555
你猜怎么着  你说的很对
You know what... you're right.
 
151
00:07:09,573 --> 00:07:11,607
为何我天生就这么帅气啊
Why did I have to be born so handsome?
