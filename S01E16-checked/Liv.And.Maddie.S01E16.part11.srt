354
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:40,460
好吧  乔伊  你能办到的
All right, Joey. You got this.

355
00:16:40,494 --> 00:16:44,431
在这个弱不禁风的身体里面
Inside this scrawny, un-athletic, muscle-free sack of bones

356
00:16:44,465 --> 00:16:46,466
是一个往返跑高手
is a natural-born shuttle runner.

357
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,718
您这么对我说我很荣幸
That means a lot coming from you.

358
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:50,554
但是丝毫无用啊
But it's useless.

359
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:53,557
我不可能在 35 秒里面跑完往返跑
There is no way I can do this in 35 seconds.

360
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:58,395
我的结业致辞就算是泡汤了
I can kiss valedictorian a good-bye.

361
00:16:58,446 --> 00:16:59,613
老兄  你能行的
Dude, it's going to be okay.

362
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,448
你只要充分信任你的第一感觉
Just trust your instincts.

363
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:03,533
这个叫迪吉的兄弟多少还是有些锦囊妙计的
And know that the dig-man still has a couple tricks up his sleeve.

364
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:05,702
还有  你最好把鞋带系好
Also, you might want to tie your shoe.

365
00:17:05,736 --> 00:17:07,454
啊  呵呵  是啊
Ah, pfft. Yeah.

366
00:17:07,488 --> 00:17:08,738
准备好了么  乔伊
All right, Joey.

367
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:11,408
这是你往返跑补考的唯一一次机会
You get one last shot to pass your shuttle run.

368
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,692
好的
Okay.

369
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:15,579
在此之前  我有个问题
But before we do this... question.

370
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,414
- 跑  - 好的
- Go! - Okay.

371
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:19,666
不要
No!

372
00:17:21,368 --> 00:17:24,537
恶心
Gross!

373
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:25,755
快跑啊  乔伊  快跑
Run, Joey, run!

374
00:17:25,806 --> 00:17:28,374
乔伊  你想和我一起去舞会吗
Joey, you want to go to prom?

375
00:17:28,392 --> 00:17:30,677
不  不  不  不  不
No no no no no!

377
00:17:32,597 --> 00:17:36,349
25.4 秒  你打破了校记录
25.4. That's a new school record.

378
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,402
我的儿子是个运动员
My son's a jock.

379
00:17:39,437 --> 00:17:42,606
我的儿子居然是个运动员
My son's a jock!

380
00:17:42,657 --> 00:17:45,558
好啊
Yeah.

381
00:17:47,361 --> 00:17:49,579
多谢了  迪吉  这事没了你成不了
Thanks, Diggie. Couldn't have done it without you.

382
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:52,582
恭喜啦  亲爱的
Congratulations, little man.

383
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:55,368
谢谢了
Thanks.

384
00:17:55,402 --> 00:17:56,620
我已经累得跑不动了
I'm too tired to run away.

385
00:17:56,704 --> 00:18:00,290
我知道
I know.
