2
00:00:04,815 --> 00:00:06,849
接着转  接着转
And turn. And turn.
 
3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,902
- 接着转  接着转  - 停
- And turn. And turn. - And stop.
 
4
00:00:09,937 --> 00:00:12,855
丽芙  我又不是你的私人超模
Liv, I'm not your personal supermodel.
 
5
00:00:12,906 --> 00:00:14,941
哦  玛蒂  我从来没说过你是啊
Oh, Maddie, I never said you were.
 
6
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:16,909
你可是我的三维镜子
You are my 3-d mirror.
 
7
00:00:16,977 --> 00:00:18,511
那好
Okay.
 
8
00:00:18,545 --> 00:00:21,781
你的三维镜子就要辞职不干了
Well, your 3D mirror is about to quit.
 
9
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,833
我这周要和灰熊队打一场比赛
I have a big game against the grizzlies this week
 
10
00:00:23,867 --> 00:00:25,585
这双脚将是要上篮球场的
and these feet need to be on a basketball court.
 
11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,754
- 所以  - 啊  我可要提醒你
- So... - Ah! Need I remind you
 
12
00:00:27,788 --> 00:00:29,789
这次时尚的小短会算是次报复
that this little fashion sesh is payback
 
13
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:34,827
报复你把我最喜欢的羊绒衫混在别的衣服里面  洗的缩水缩成这样
for you tossing my favorite cashmere sweater in the laundry.
 
14
00:00:34,845 --> 00:00:36,662
好吧
Okay.
 
15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,498
为什么女孩子都这么痴迷于鞋子啊
Why do girls get so excited about shoes?
 
16
00:00:39,516 --> 00:00:40,883
我的意思是  它们不过就是用来垫脚的嘛
I mean, they're just things to put on your feet
 
17
00:00:40,934 --> 00:00:43,603
这样你踩到一坨大粪就不会得钩虫病了
so that if you step in dog poop you don't get hookworm.
 
19
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:48,691
玛蒂  一双合适的高跟鞋能让一个女孩感到魔力四射
Maddie, the right pair of heels can make a girl feel magical.
 
20
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:51,944
而她的妈妈也可以借走享受享受魔力
And her mother when she borrows them.
 
21
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:56,682
站住
Stop.
 
22
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,518
你们为什么要拖着一堆树枝穿堂入室啊
Why are you dragging tree branches through the house?
 
23
00:00:59,536 --> 00:01:01,871
如果穿过房子而不是绕过房子的话
Going through the house instead of around
 
24
00:01:01,905 --> 00:01:06,576
能让我们提前 27 步抵达削木机
gets us to the wood chipper 27 steps faster.
 
25
00:01:06,627 --> 00:01:10,529
顺便还能让我们在厨房喝一杯又冰又甜的柠檬水
Plus we can stop in the kitchen for a nice, cold glass of lemonade.
 
26
00:01:10,547 --> 00:01:15,468
对哦  不过这还会在房子里留下一堆等着某人收拾的烂叶子
Right. It also creates a trail of leaves for someone to clean up later.
 
27
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:19,589
噢
Oh.
 
28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,593
好了  把东西收拾好吧
Okay, well, let's... let's wrap this up.
 
29
00:01:23,644 --> 00:01:26,763
别这样  玛蒂  难道这里就没有一点点合你口味的东西么
Come on, Maddie, there's not even a little part of you that's enjoying this?
 
30
00:01:26,814 --> 00:01:29,599
等一下  丽芙  让我想一想
Oh, hold on, Liv. Let me check real quick.
 
31
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,717
呃  一点都没有
Um... no.
 
32
00:01:32,936 --> 00:01:34,687
真的吗
Seriously?
 
33
00:01:34,721 --> 00:01:37,556
得了吧  玛蒂  你不能整辈子都只穿运动鞋啊
Okay, you can't wear sneakers for the rest of your life, Maddie.
 
34
00:01:37,574 --> 00:01:40,893
你猜怎么着  你要激发你内心的光芒
You know what... you need to tap into your inner sparkle.
 
35
00:01:42,562 --> 00:01:47,900
让你的小四眼好好欣赏欣赏  这双鞋
Feast your four eyes... on these!
 
36
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:53,790
我已经找到了最好的高跟鞋
I have found the perfect pumps.
 
37
00:01:53,841 --> 00:01:57,510
哦  闻起来就像走在时尚最前沿的一碗布丁上一样
Oh! It's as if you were walking around in a bowl of high-fashion pudding.
 
38
00:01:57,544 --> 00:01:58,711
好的  好的  你够了
Okay, okay, enough.
 
39
00:01:58,745 --> 00:01:59,879
我会试穿它的
I will try them on.
 
41
00:02:01,682 --> 00:02:05,468
好吧  但是要小心  你一旦把它撑大了我就穿不了了
Okay, just be careful, 'cause if you stretch 'em I can't wear 'em.
 
42
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,919
你们有十秒的时间
You guys have ten seconds.
 
43
00:02:06,937 --> 00:02:08,521
抓紧看吧
Look quick.
 
44
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:10,890
10  9  8
10, 9, 8...
 
47
00:02:15,896 --> 00:02:18,447
哇  我的亲娘啊
Whoa, mama.
 
48
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:19,816
原来这就是由内而外的光芒啊
Hello, inner sparkle.
 
49
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:22,451
我爱死这双鞋了
I love these shoes.
 
50
00:02:22,486 --> 00:02:24,453
我真讨厌这双鞋
I hate these shoes.
 
51
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:31,544
好吧  你能骗一个假小子穿上女装  但你永远没法让她美丽动人的
Well, you can lead a tomboy to designer shoes but you can't make her shimmer.
