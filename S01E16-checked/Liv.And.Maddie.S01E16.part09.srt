279
00:12:57,757 --> 00:12:59,791
嘿  丽芙
Hey, Liv.

280
00:12:59,825 --> 00:13:02,761
你来有何贵干
What are you doing here?

281
00:13:02,795 --> 00:13:06,932
我来接你去参加那场比赛
Well, I'm here to take you back to the game.

282
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,768
不过这是怎么回事
But what is all of this?

283
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,887
哦  你可是说对了
Oh, you were so right.

284
00:13:11,938 --> 00:13:14,773
我可喜欢这双鞋子了
I love these shoes!

285
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:16,692
哦

286
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,010
这事情我们可以稍后再谈
Well, okay, we can talk about that later.

287
00:13:19,028 --> 00:13:21,530
你先把这双鞋子脱了  我这就要接你去参加比赛
Just kick those off and we will get you back to the game.

288
00:13:21,564 --> 00:13:22,948
噗  我才不去什么比赛咧
Pfft. I'm not going back to that game.

290
00:13:23,983 --> 00:13:26,702
你到底是谁
Who are you?

291
00:13:26,736 --> 00:13:30,572
我是一个喜欢穿高跟鞋  闪闪发亮的软妹子
I am a shoe-loving sparkly girl.

293
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:33,959
你要不要和我一起模仿那些超模啊
Do you want to play supermodel with me?

294
00:13:33,993 --> 00:13:35,860
呵呵
Yeah.

295
00:13:35,878 --> 00:13:38,797
当然了
Of course I do.

297
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,804
停  停  停  停
No no no no.

298
00:13:45,838 --> 00:13:48,640
这  这腔调不对
This... this is wrong.

299
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:52,728
玛蒂整个失控了
Maddie was out of control.

300
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,880
呼  这个任务看来比我想象的困难多了
Whew, this was a much bigger job than I thought it was going to be.

301
00:13:55,898 --> 00:13:58,883
我肯定是要找后援了
And I was definitely going to need backup.

302
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,018
不过
But first...

303
00:14:00,052 --> 00:14:01,737
行  就一分钟
Okay, one minute.

304
00:14:01,771 --> 00:14:02,821
好的
Yes.
