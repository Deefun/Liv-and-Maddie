306
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:16,349
您真的不需要我们帮什么忙么  妈
Are you sure we can't help you with something, mom?

307
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,536
哦  不  你们两个小家伙就在这里给我好好坐着
Oh, no. You boys just sit here and do not lift a finger.

308
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,321
免得又磕了碰了  把什么东西打了
You might break one of them too.

309
00:14:22,657 --> 00:14:24,741
我得去处理一下花园里面那堆事情
I am going to do some yard work.

310
00:14:24,792 --> 00:14:26,576
遵命
You're the boss.

311
00:14:26,627 --> 00:14:28,745
任务达成
Mission accomplished.

312
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,664
帕克的方法
The Parker way.

315
00:14:40,374 --> 00:14:42,709
这机器真赞
It's beautiful.

316
00:14:42,727 --> 00:14:46,730
您在干什么呢  鲁尼女士
Um, what are you doing, Mrs. Rooney?

317
00:14:46,764 --> 00:14:49,433
哦  你懂的  把这些残枝断梗的
Oh, you know, just jamming these big branches

318
00:14:49,484 --> 00:14:51,401
塞进这台一百马力的机器里面
into this hundred-horsepower monster

319
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,438
里面还有四十片不锈钢旋转刀片
with 40 razor-sharp stainless steel teeth.

321
00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:00,610
哇
Whoa!

323
00:15:02,396 --> 00:15:04,414
不会吧  我们能帮忙么
No way. Can we help?

324
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,701
呵呵  孩子  要是我不觉得你能把盘子放到水盆里面而不打掉
Oh, sweetie, if I can't trust you to carry your plate to the sink,

325
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,504
我怎么可能让你靠近这台机器呢
then I sure can't trust you around this bad boy.

326
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:12,739
此话当真
Seriously?

327
00:15:12,757 --> 00:15:16,376
我没有比这更想做的事情了啊
But there is nothing I've ever wanted to do more.

328
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:20,464
话说  既然我这么想了  我要取消你的空手道课
You know, now that I think about it, I'm pulling you out of karate

329
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,582
我也要在你的自行车上重新装上从轮
and I'm putting the training wheels back on your bike.

330
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,771
好消息是  我帮你们买了蜡笔和安全剪刀
But the good news is... bought you some crayons and safety scissors.

331
00:15:27,805 --> 00:15:30,390
就在里面  要我抱你进去么
They're inside. You want uppy?

332
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,561
做的不错啊  帕克
Nice work, Parker.

333
00:15:34,595 --> 00:15:37,397
我们就连这个都做不成了
We got ourselves out of that one.

334
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:41,785
赞啊
Sweet!

335
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:43,653
这是那款 64 色的
It's the 64 pack.

336
00:15:43,704 --> 00:15:46,790
盒子里面还有内建的卷笔刀呢
It has a sharpener built into the box.

337
00:15:46,824 --> 00:15:50,410
哦  等等  你妈妈把那个也拿走了
Oh, wait. Your mom took that out.

339
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:53,463
耶  宝贝
Yeah, baby!

340
00:15:53,498 --> 00:15:55,415
天  这听上去还真有趣
Man, that sounds like fun.

341
00:15:55,449 --> 00:15:56,716
比这还有趣
More fun than all this?

343
00:15:58,753 --> 00:16:00,637
这套里面有深棕黄色的蜡笔呢
Burnt sienna.

344
00:16:00,671 --> 00:16:02,472
喔呼
Whoo-hoo!

345
00:16:02,507 --> 00:16:04,624
我不敢相信她居然不让我们两个帮忙
I can't believe she's not letting us help.

346
00:16:04,642 --> 00:16:06,560
正是
Exactly.

347
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:10,630
拜你所赐  她以后再也不会让我们做这种有趣的事情了
Thanks to you, she'll never let us do stuff like that again.

348
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,733
我们要不要击掌
Can a brother get a fist bump?

349
00:16:17,471 --> 00:16:22,359
是不是说我如果什么都不做  就什么都做不成了
So if I don't ever do anything, I don't ever get to do anything?

350
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:27,647
这是我对帕克的方法的基本理解
It was my understanding that was the primary message of the Parker way.

351
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:31,701
看来帕克的方法存在指向错误
Well, perhaps the Parker way is misguided.

352
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:34,421
新鲜的玛芬蛋糕能不能然你觉得好过一点
Would fresh-baked muffins make this better?

353
00:16:34,455 --> 00:16:36,423
当然
Certainly couldn't hurt.
