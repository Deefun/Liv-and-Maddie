386
00:18:01,626 --> 00:18:05,595
好咧  各位都准备好干预一下玛蒂的行为了
Okay, so we are all here for Maddie's intervention.

387
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,430
我们一定要让她走进这间房间的时候
It is very important that we make her feel

388
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:09,582
感觉到这里是一个这是一个安全
like she's walking into a room that is safe,

389
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,636
充满着爱意和支持  小污点
and loving, and supportive and... Stains!

390
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:15,355
我真想把你手里的袋子拍掉
I am going to slap that bag out of your hands.

391
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:19,592
既然你不想任何人吃为啥还要把它们拿出来
Why did you put them out if you don't want anyone to eat them?

392
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:30,770
嘿
Hey...!

393
00:18:30,788 --> 00:18:33,456
嘿啊
Hey.

394
00:18:33,491 --> 00:18:35,458
嘿
Hey.

395
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:38,411
你们在这干嘛
What are you guys doing here?

396
00:18:38,445 --> 00:18:41,581
为什么都盯着我看
And why are you all staring at me?

397
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:44,551
为什么刚才维罗把前门锁了
And why did willow just lock the front door?

398
00:18:44,585 --> 00:18:46,503
是啊  为什么呢
Yeah, why did she?

399
00:18:46,554 --> 00:18:50,307
这让我有点儿紧张
It's making me nervous.

400
00:18:50,341 --> 00:18:55,512
玛蒂  我们来这儿是为了谈谈你的问题的
Maddie, we are all here to talk to you about your problem.

401
00:18:55,563 --> 00:18:58,481
什么问  我没有问题啊
What pro... I don't have a problem.

402
00:18:58,516 --> 00:18:59,566
不  你有
Yeah, you do.

403
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,518
你对那些鞋子上瘾了
You're obsessed with those shoes.

404
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:03,353
我没有上瘾
I am not obsessed.

405
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:04,604
它们是我新的好朋友
They're just my new best friends

406
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,639
你的世界里唯一重要的东西
and the only things in the world that matter.

407
00:19:06,657 --> 00:19:09,526
你以前告诉过我你多么讨厌高跟鞋
You used to tell me how you hated high heels.

408
00:19:09,577 --> 00:19:12,329
我们周天的激励散步难道没有任何意义吗
Have our Sunday afternoon empowerment walk means nothing?!

409
00:19:12,363 --> 00:19:14,581
呃
Okay.

410
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:16,700
我以前不喜欢高跟鞋  可是我现在喜欢了啊
So I used to not like them and now I do.

411
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:18,535
我说的是  一个女孩有权利改变主意
I mean, a girl has the right to change her mind

412
00:19:18,586 --> 00:19:20,486
有权利改变主意了之后告诉她的朋友和家人
and also tell her friends and family

413
00:19:20,504 --> 00:19:22,488
他们是多讨厌  别再烦一个可怜的女孩儿了
that they are annoying and should stop bothering her.

414
00:19:22,506 --> 00:19:27,510
丽芙  是你告诉我去拥抱我的内在光芒的啊
I mean, Liv, you were the one who told me to embrace my inner sparkle.

415
00:19:27,545 --> 00:19:29,763
是我说的没错  但是我发现我错了
I did, but I was wrong.

416
00:19:29,797 --> 00:19:32,515
玛蒂  看看你  你现在的生活完全本末倒置了
I mean, Maddie, now your priorities are all out of whack.

417
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,666
你错过了一场比赛
You missed a game.

418
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,435
是啊  天  我都被逼上场了
Yeah, man. I had to play.

419
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:37,721
我进了个球  自摆乌龙
I made a basket... for the other team.

420
00:19:39,774 --> 00:19:41,641
那我们说好去吃冰淇淋的事怎么办
And what about our fro-yo date?

421
00:19:41,675 --> 00:19:45,395
玛蒂  那天冰淇淋还买一送一呢
Mads, it was two-for-one toppings night.

422
00:19:45,446 --> 00:19:48,398
而且我讨厌你比我高
And I hate that you're taller than me.

423
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:51,401
这话真是出口为快
There. I said it.

424
00:19:51,452 --> 00:19:53,686
我通过了往返跑哦
And I passed the shuttle run.

425
00:19:55,355 --> 00:19:59,692
虽然和我们的对话并不相关  但我还是想说  我太自豪了
Not relevant to what we're talking about, but I'm just so proud of myself.

426
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:05,698
好了  伙计们  不过是一双  等等  你过了
Okay, guys, it's just a pair of... wait, hold on. You passed?

427
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:08,334
你知道吗  只要我想随时我都可以把它们脱下来
You know what? I can take these off whenever I want to.

428
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,502
哈
Ha!

429
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:12,338
好啊  那你脱啊
Okay, then do it.

430
00:20:12,372 --> 00:20:16,676
恩  我说的是我想的时候
Well, I said that I can take them off whenever I want to,

431
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,562
但是我现在不想
and I just don't want to right now.

432
00:20:19,597 --> 00:20:20,764
然后尼
So...

433
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:22,381
自己看着办吧
Deal with it.

434
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,517
噢  我们会的  大家动手啊
Oh, we will. Now!

435
00:20:24,551 --> 00:20:26,770
迪吉  抓住她的腿
Diggie, grab her legs.

436
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:28,521
噢
Oh!

437
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:29,773
放我下来
Put me down!

438
00:20:29,824 --> 00:20:33,610
这是怎  我的鞋子
Wha... my shoes!

440
00:20:36,497 --> 00:20:39,749
丽芙  把我的鞋子还给我
Liv, give me back my shoes.

441
00:20:39,784 --> 00:20:41,584
噢  松饼
Ooh! Muffins.

442
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:44,403
请别介意
Don't mind if I do.

443
00:20:44,422 --> 00:20:45,455
丽芙  不要啊
Liv, no!

444
00:20:45,506 --> 00:20:47,573
请别惩罚这双高跟鞋啊
Don't punish the pumps.

445
00:20:47,591 --> 00:20:48,758
哦  相信我  玛蒂
Oh, believe me, Maddie.

446
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:51,628
这给我的伤害比给你的伤害多了去了
This is going to hurt me a lot more than it's going to hurt you.

447
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:53,713
哦  等等  我说啥来着
Oh... Wait, what am I saying?

448
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:55,581
难道丽芙·鲁尼能忍心
Like there's any way in the universe

449
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,767
可以毁掉一双超赞的……
that Liv Rooney would destroy the perfect pair of...

451
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,439
不
No!

453
00:21:03,691 --> 00:21:05,391
这就结束了
It's over now.

454
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:08,561
一切都会好起来的
It's going to start to get better.

455
00:21:08,595 --> 00:21:10,697
但是太难了
But this is so hard.

456
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:14,400
我的脚  要冻死了
And my feet are... So cold.

457
00:21:14,434 --> 00:21:18,771
有些老朋友想打个招呼
I have a couple of old friends who want to say hi.

458
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,541
噢
Oh.

459
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:22,792
谢谢
Thank you.

460
00:21:22,827 --> 00:21:24,577
哇
Wow.

461
00:21:24,611 --> 00:21:26,713
我不知道我是怎么了
I don't know what came over me.

462
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:29,415
玛蒂  你找到了你的内在的光芒呀
Well, Maddie, you tapped into your inner sparkle.

463
00:21:29,449 --> 00:21:32,385
是啊伙计  每个人都会这样
Yeah, man. It happens to all of us.

464
00:21:34,788 --> 00:21:38,641
幸运的是  你有一个对这种闪闪发光的东西了如指掌的姐姐
Luckily, you have a sister to guide you through all things sparkly.

465
00:21:38,676 --> 00:21:39,726
我们一步一步慢慢来
So we will start slow.

466
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,761
嗯  这是草莓味唇彩
Okay, this is strawberry lip gloss.

467
00:21:41,795 --> 00:21:43,513
你可别把它吃了
Don't eat it.
