152
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:19,731
噢  嘿
Oh, hey.
 
153
00:07:19,749 --> 00:07:22,568
听说你感觉不太舒服
Heard you weren't feeling very well.
 
154
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:23,902
啊  是的  大概是虫子什么的吧
Oh, yeah. Must be a bug or something.
 
155
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,590
唔  我希望你明天对阵灰熊队的比赛能发挥正常啊
Mm, well, I hope you'll be okay for the game against the grizzlies tomorrow.
 
156
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,708
我觉得经过一晚上的睡眠应该能恢复好的
I'm pretty sure I'll be fine after a good night's sleep.
 
157
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:31,710
嗯哼  要我给你拿点姜汁汽水么
Mm-hmm. Can I get you some ginger ale?
 
158
00:07:31,744 --> 00:07:33,879
或是一些咸饼干
Or some crackers?
 
159
00:07:33,913 --> 00:07:36,682
呃  不用了  我感觉挺好的
Um, no, I'm... I'm fine.
 
160
00:07:36,716 --> 00:07:38,851
而且我的床在这边
I'm also over here.
 
161
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,519
你在找什么呢
What are you looking for?
 
162
00:07:40,554 --> 00:07:41,887
哦
Oh!
 
163
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,639
有点头脑发热吧
A fever.
 
164
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:47,560
哎呀呀
Aww!
 
165
00:07:49,646 --> 00:07:50,729
嘿  妈  妈
Hey, mom. Mom.
 
166
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:52,448
咋了
Hmm?
 
167
00:07:52,482 --> 00:07:53,899
你在找丽芙的那双漂亮鞋子  对不
You're looking for Liv's perfect pumps, aren't you?
 
168
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,568
什么  才不是呢
What? No.
 
169
00:07:55,602 --> 00:07:58,454
不  我  我根本停不住对鞋的思念
No, I... I can't stop thinking about them.
 
170
00:07:58,488 --> 00:08:00,656
我想立马穿上
I want to slip 'em on.
 
171
00:08:00,707 --> 00:08:03,542
哪怕只穿一个趾头  我就是想过过瘾
Even just a toe. I just need a taste.
 
172
00:08:04,578 --> 00:08:07,713
呃  那个  其实高跟鞋不在这里
Mm, yeah, well, they're actually not in here.
 
173
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:09,465
我刚看见丽芙来过找了一轮了
I just saw Liv coming and looking for them.
 
174
00:08:09,499 --> 00:08:12,418
所以我要是看见了的话会通知你的
So if I see them, I will let you know.
 
175
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:13,802
但是  嘿  妈妈  与此同时
But... hey, mom. In the meantime,
 
176
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:17,623
你或许应该想想你的尊严该穿在哪里
you might want to slip on a size 10 dose of dignity.
 
177
00:08:17,641 --> 00:08:18,757
你说得对
You're right.
 
178
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,559
我不知道我怎么像着了魔一样
I don't know what's gotten into me.
 
179
00:08:20,594 --> 00:08:21,844
如果你胆敢告诉丽芙我来过这儿  你就会
If you tell Liv I was here, and you will be...
 
180
00:08:21,895 --> 00:08:23,846
我到底是怎么了
what's wrong with me?
 
181
00:08:28,468 --> 00:08:32,571
嗨  宝贝们
Hi, girls.
 
182
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:33,822
我刚骗走了我妈
I just lied to my mom.
 
183
00:08:33,857 --> 00:08:35,774
还是关于鞋子的
About shoes.
 
185
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:43,832
哈  而且我根本就不在乎
Ha! And I don't even care.
