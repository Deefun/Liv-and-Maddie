74
00:03:24,548 --> 00:03:26,599
来尝尝  鲁尼女士
Here you go, Mrs. Rooney.
 
75
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,601
我烤制了新鲜的松饼
I baked fresh muffins.
 
76
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,637
我的哥们埃文真是个好客人
My buddy Evan is the perfect houseguest.
 
77
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,505
他自己整理床铺  他帮着拿报纸
He makes his bed. He gets the paper.
 
78
00:03:33,523 --> 00:03:34,607
他还会烤松饼
He bakes fresh muffins.
 
79
00:03:34,641 --> 00:03:35,808
简直是太周到了
He's just so thoughtful,
 
80
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:38,477
而且干活的时候满是雀斑的小脸上堆满了笑容
and does it all with a smile on that sweet, freckly face.
 
81
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,846
他让我看起来糟透了
He's really making me look bad.
 
82
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,900
好的  谢谢你  埃文
Well, thank you, Evan.
 
83
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:46,869
我还没习惯这么贴心的照顾
I am not used to all this attention.
 
84
00:03:46,904 --> 00:03:48,621
咳咳
Ahem.
 
85
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:53,525
长命百岁
Bless you?
 
86
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:59,916
我太谢谢你们能在我妈出去开会的时候让我住在这儿了
I really appreciate you letting me stay here while my mom's at a convention.
 
87
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:02,835
为什么不休息一下  等我把这里收拾干净呢
Why don't you take a few minutes for yourself and I'll clean up here?
 
88
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:05,504
你简直是个小天使啊
You are like a dream.
 
89
00:04:05,538 --> 00:04:09,842
帕克  你也该从你朋友那里学到些什么了吧
Parker, you could learn a little something from your friend.
 
90
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,845
伙计  我们要谈谈
Dude, we gotta talk.
 
91
00:04:14,815 --> 00:04:18,734
太棒了  我妈说谈话时给精神减负的最好方法
Great! My mom says talking is the best way to unburden your soul.
 
92
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:23,906
我理解你想多帮帮忙的心情  但是你给我妈做的事越多
I totally get you're trying to be helpful, but the more you do for my mom,
 
93
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:26,609
她对我的期望值就越大
the more she'll expect from me.
 
94
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,611
我现在生活过得这么舒坦
I got a good thing going here.
 
95
00:04:28,662 --> 00:04:32,698
我绝不需要你插一脚来毁掉了它
And I don't need you waltzing in and ruining it!
 
96
00:04:32,732 --> 00:04:35,785
我妈说帮人做事就像是释放光芒
My mom says being helpful is a ray of light
 
97
00:04:35,836 --> 00:04:37,753
我可以以此照亮温馨的小家
I can just shine on our happy home.
 
98
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:40,673
那是假话
Not true.
 
99
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:43,926
她这么说是想在家务活上偷懒呢
The goal is to get out of chores.
 
100
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,463
噗
Pfft.
 
101
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:49,849
帕克  你真逗啊
Parker, you're hilarious.
 
102
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:54,586
哦  等等  你是认真的么
Oh, wait, you're serious?
 
103
00:04:54,604 --> 00:04:57,890
如果你的父母认为你干什么事都干不成
If your parents think that you're not capable of doing anything,
 
104
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,776
你就不需要做任何家务活了
you'll never have to do another chore again.
 
106
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,763
那个世界难道存在么
Does such a world exist?!
 
107
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,482
确实存在
It does.
 
108
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,766
让我来教你一套方法
Let me show you a way.
 
109
00:05:07,784 --> 00:05:10,486
更好的方法
A better way.
 
110
00:05:10,537 --> 00:05:12,455
帕克的方法
The Parker way.
