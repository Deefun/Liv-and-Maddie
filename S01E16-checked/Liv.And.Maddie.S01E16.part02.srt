53
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:35,631
最好的朋友
Better in stereo

54
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,717
不同的朋友
b... b... better in stereo

55
00:02:37,751 --> 00:02:39,669
迎着清晨阳光
-  I'm up with the sunshine -  Let's go

56
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,921
穿上舒服衣裳
-  I lace up my high tops -  Oh no

57
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:43,840
扣篮  热热身
-  slam dunk -  Ready or not

58
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,509
秀出你的份量
yeah, show me what you got

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,728
站在舞台中央
-  I'm under the spotlight -  Holler

60
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,730
准备下一场较量
I dare you, come on and follow

61
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,648
你有你的节拍
you dance to your own beat

62
00:02:52,683 --> 00:02:54,734
我的歌声嘹亮
I'll sing the melody

63
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:56,736
你想接受
when you say yea-ah-ah

64
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,905
我却摇头
I say no-oh-oh

65
00:02:58,939 --> 00:02:59,906
你想停留
when you say stop

66
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:03,743
我却一心只想  走走走
all I want to do is go, go, go

67
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:06,746
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the other half of me, me

68
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,481
学不来的朋友
the half I'll never be-e

69
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:12,585
截然不同的朋友
the half that drives me crazy

70
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:15,504
你  我最好的朋友
you, you, the better half of me, me

71
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,673
离不开的朋友
the half I'll always need

72
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,675
你我有
but we both know

73
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,627
不或缺的朋友
we're better in stereo.
