546
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:24,935
Liv, you were absolutely right.

547
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,937
It is mind-blowing what I can accomplish

548
00:23:26,939 --> 00:23:28,906
from the passenger seat of the car.

549
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,008
I paid a bill, ordered some cute tops,

550
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,576
and adopted a penguin.

551
00:23:33,945 --> 00:23:36,113
- ( Phone chimes ) - Ooh! Incoming.

552
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,614
- ( Chimes ) - Oh!

553
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,549
Aah! ( Laughing )

554
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,752
That's funny.

555
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:43,954
Maddie just sent me the funniest photo.

556
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,589
- You boys want to see it? - Yeah. Yeah yeah.

557
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,925
Okay, I'll send.

558
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,726
( Phone chimes, makes springing noise )

559
00:23:49,728 --> 00:23:52,829
( All laugh )

560
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,965
That's classic!

561
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:58,502
What is everybody laughing at?

562
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:00,637
What are we looking at? What's so funny?

563
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:01,872
I hate driving!
