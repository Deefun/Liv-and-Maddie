305
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,141
Pull over to talk or text.

306
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,946
Mmm! Gotta love a brown sugar glaze.

307
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:30,281
( Blows whistle )

308
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,450
No eating in the halls.

309
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,518
I can't help it, coach.

310
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,320
Just falls off the bone.

311
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,291
That's some solid-looking barbecue you got there.

312
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,293
Thank you.

313
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:45,263
I followed a recipe from "Barbecue Monthly."

314
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:50,001
Oh! Too much black pepper.

315
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,036
Ah, it was all so confusing.

316
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,372
My father's...

317
00:12:54,374 --> 00:12:55,439
A vegetarian.

318
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,842
( Winces )

319
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,044
I just have no one to guide me.

320
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,313
Well, I don't like to brag,

321
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,982
but last summer I did win

322
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,853
the Stevens Point "Thrilla on the Grilla" cook-off.

323
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,023
Oh, yeah! Coach Rooney took the barbecue bait.

324
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,924
But seriously, not one word about the haircut?

325
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,926
What gives?
