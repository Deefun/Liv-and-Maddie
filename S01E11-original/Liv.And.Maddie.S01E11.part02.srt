66
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:38,823
Better in stereo

67
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,892
b... b... better in stereo

68
00:02:40,894 --> 00:02:42,927
-  I'm up with the sunshine -  Let's go

69
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,530
-  I lace up my high tops -  Oh no

70
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,365
slam dunk, ready or not

71
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,933
yeah, show me what you got

72
00:02:48,935 --> 00:02:51,536
-  I'm under the spotlight -  Holler

73
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:53,538
I dare you, come on and follow

74
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,807
you dance to your own beat

75
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,809
I'll sing the melody

76
00:02:57,811 --> 00:03:00,512
when you say yea-ah-ah

77
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:02,447
I say no-oh-oh

78
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:04,716
when you say stop

79
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:07,218
all I want to do is go go go

80
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,221
you you, the other half of me me

81
00:03:10,223 --> 00:03:12,223
the half I'll never be-e

82
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,894
the half that drives me crazy

83
00:03:15,896 --> 00:03:18,897
you you, the better half of me me

84
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,366
the half I'll always need

85
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:22,834
but we both know

86
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:24,836
we're better in stereo.
