89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,777
Guys! I have something really exciting to say.

90
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:37,248
How about you pause your piehole for two hours?

91
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,785
We'll get to you later.

92
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,288
We're all listening, Liv.

93
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,456
Okay.

94
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,624
There is a major film

95
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,493
shooting in Wisconsin this summer,

96
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,728
and I'm up for a big part.

97
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,829
How exciting! What's it about?

98
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,966
It's based on some book about wolves in space.

99
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,603
Both: "Space Werewolves!"

100
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,807
( Squeals ) That is my favorite graphic novel.

101
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,042
No way!

102
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,844
They want me to play Tristan.

103
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,480
As in Tristan Lycanth?

104
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,481
Yeah.

105
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,950
The hero?

106
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,918
Ha ha, but Tristan's a boy.

107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,854
Technically half-boy, half-werewolf.

108
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,923
But he is definitely not a girl.

109
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,926
Right. Not yet.

110
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,362
But the people making the movie saw my episode of Sing it  Loud!

111
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,766
right where I dreamt that I was on an international space station

112
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,367
and I saved the earth by singing the high note

113
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,469
that shattered the asteroid before it hit earth. Aah!

114
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,871
( Sings high note )

115
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,607
( Imitates explosion )

116
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,308
I love that episode.

117
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,410
Really? 'Cause I had some logic problems with it.

118
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,678
But you sparkled, honey.

119
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,816
They liked it so much that they're considering changing the role of Tristan

120
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,385
into a girl just for me.

121
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,722
I had to stop Liv for her own good.

122
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,624
Fanboys are crazy.

123
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,325
I should know. I'm one of them.

124
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:55,527
( Clicks tongue )

125
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,729
We're talking about Tristan Lycanth.

126
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,865
Keeper of the claw of freedom.

127
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,736
Does this match this?
