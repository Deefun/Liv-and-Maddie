1
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:10,775
Okay, Liv and Maddie will be back from their driving test any second.

2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,444
Ready to celebrate?

3
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,112
Check it.

4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,384
Sing it loud!

5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,386
Bam! What?!

6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,656
Ooh, I can't wait to get my license

7
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,658
and be able to go wherever I want.

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,460
( Laughs ) Within the city limits.

9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,061
Before my curfew.

10
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,031
In a beat-up minivan that smells like Joey's feet.

11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,433
Still freedom.

12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,668
Whoo-hoo!

13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,769
Freedom?

14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,639
( Scoffs ) Try loss of freedom.

15
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,507
Who wants to drive when you can sit shotgun

16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,109
and text until your thumbs fall off?

17
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,477
( Chuckles ) Not me.

18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,546
I'm stoked for Maddie. Having a license...

19
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,481
that means she can go anywhere and do anything.

20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,550
That a responsible teenager would do

21
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,184
after getting approval from her father.

22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,354
Not that I've ever asked her not to get approval.

23
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,622
Why am I still talking?

24
00:00:57,624 --> 00:00:58,723
( Mouthing )

25
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,824
Why are you in my house?

26
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,459
Why haven't you gotten a haircut?

27
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,129
We've all got questions.

28
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,231
( Gasps ) There she is.

29
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,766
- ( All cheer ) - Congratulations, Liv.

30
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,235
One of our two new drivers.

31
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,770
Yes. Hold your rah-rahs.

32
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,205
Only one of us passed.

33
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,174
Total bummer-rang.

34
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,776
Aw, you'll get it next time, kid.

35
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,679
No. I'm the one who passed.

36
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,481
( Laughs ) License to surprise!

37
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,851
Wait, if you passed, that means Maddie failed.

38
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,554
Maddie doesn't fail anything.

39
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,822
- Ooh! - Oh!

40
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:33,091
( Shouts )

41
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,294
Burn it! Burn it all!

42
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,729
( All chatter )

43
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,564
Well...

44
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,733
I failed.

45
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,835
Guess I know what it feels like to be a loser now.

46
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,638
You know what I'm talking about, Joey.

47
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,842
Ouch! I would call that a drive-by...

48
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,844
if you had your license.

49
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,479
( Imitates explosion )

50
00:01:57,883 --> 00:01:59,250
So what happened?

51
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,752
I will tell you what happened.

52
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,587
The DMV discriminates.

53
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,756
Yeah. They only give their licenses

54
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,826
to people who can make left-hand turns.

55
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,796
They do come in handy when you want to go left.

56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,499
Why would you purposefully turn

57
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,368
into oncoming traffic when you can go up one block

58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,869
and make three rights?

59
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,806
Who needs their license anyway, am I right?

60
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,843
I do! I need my license!

61
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,912
Don't worry, Maddie. I'll drive you anywhere you want to go.

62
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,314
Seriously, why am I still talking?

63
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,715
Why am I still here?

64
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,250
I'll go get my hair cut.
