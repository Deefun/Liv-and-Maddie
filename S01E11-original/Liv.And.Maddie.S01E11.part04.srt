129
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,010
- What's up, Diggie? - What's up, Rooney?

130
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,813
'Sup with your hair?

131
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,782
You did not get a haircut

132
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,317
just because my dad told you to.

133
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,520
( Scoffs ) No. Not at all.

134
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,056
I totally needed a trim. Do you think he'll like it?

135
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:28,927
Diggie, you can't let him push you around like this.

136
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,595
I mean, your hair was a hot mess,

137
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,764
but that's not the point.

138
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,566
I can't help it, okay? I want him to like me.

139
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,800
He's your dad. And you and me are...

140
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,036
Whatever we are.

141
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,672
Totally. Whatever.

142
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,042
Um... you just need to find something

143
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,910
that you and my dad both like and bond over that.

144
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,512
Oh, yeah, okay, great. Let's see.

145
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,081
He likes growling at me.

146
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,916
You know what else he likes...

147
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,117
barbecuing.

148
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,920
Grilling sure beats growling.

149
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,857
And, if he starts to like me,

150
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,358
I could help you prep for your driver's test.

151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,993
Aww. ( Laughs, snorts )

152
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,495
That's so sweet.

153
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,930
- Hey, Dad. - ( Exclaims )

154
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,532
( Laughs )

155
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,902
Dude, I'm kidding. Ha ha.

156
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,437
But he won't be.
