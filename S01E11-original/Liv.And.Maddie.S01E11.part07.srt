249
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,763
Web... and that's how I slay the dragon.

250
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,867
Hey, Artie, you got a minute?

251
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,968
Hey, Joey.

252
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,303
You got a girlfriend?

253
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,805
Burn!

254
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,176
How is that a burn? You took your mom to the freshman dance last fall.

255
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,083
So, what brings you crawling back

256
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,985
to the Society of Space... Space... space...

257
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,720
Were... were... were... Wol... wol... wol...

258
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,622
wol... wol... wol... ves... ves?

259
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,891
( Howls )

260
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,227
I was voted out of the Society

261
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,929
for suggesting that wolf tails were stupid.

262
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,631
Was I wrong?

263
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,800
People, was I wrong?

264
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,203
I want to talk to you about my sister Liv.

265
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,872
No la la la la.

266
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,007
We do not speak the name of that she-devil

267
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,676
who wants to desecrate Tristan.

268
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,044
Unless she sent you to ask me to prom,

269
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,607
in which case, let her know I say maybe.

270
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,382
Be gone with you.

271
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:53,684
( Yelps )

272
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,653
Listen, Artie.

273
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,155
We have a common enemy here,

274
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,789
and we need to work together

275
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,825
to defend the iconic character

276
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,094
that is Tristan.

277
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,197
We were once powerful allies, you and I.

278
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,133
An uneasy alliance.

279
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,737
My wolf ears are perked.

280
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,806
Liv will be down at Neville's tomorrow.

281
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,442
I need you to show her the real fangs

282
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,112
of a true "Space Werewolves" fanboy.

283
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,047
Fanboy?

284
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,850
That term is derogatory, sir.

285
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,054
We prefer "fantasy enthusiast."

286
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,455
So will you do it?

287
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,358
Oh, sounds great, Joey.

288
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,228
I'd happily waltz right into your trap.

289
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,463
Do you take me for a fool?!

290
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,201
Yes. Yes, I do.

291
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,272
But as Tristan himself would say...

292
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,907
( In a deep voice ) When an enemy

293
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,211
- offers his paw, lick it. - ( Mouthing along )

294
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,447
If only to tear off his hind leg...

295
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,182
Tomorrow.

296
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,052
Oh!

297
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,220
Saying no to that would be like

298
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,188
saying no to Tristan himself.

299
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,023
Well played, lone wolf.

300
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,025
Well played indeed.

301
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,094
( Howls loudly )

302
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,195
Aah!

303
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,299
Nerds!
