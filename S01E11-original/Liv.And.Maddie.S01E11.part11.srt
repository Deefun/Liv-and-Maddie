408
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:06,557
Here we are... a couple of dudes

409
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,059
getting ready to do some chillin' and grillin'.

410
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,762
Are you okay that I just called you a dude?

411
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,664
Relax, we're barbecuing.

412
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,367
Everybody's a dude.

413
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,669
Okay. Let's do this.

414
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,538
Absolutely.

415
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:23,140
First, I need you to do a few things.

416
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:25,342
Hit me. Whatever you want.

417
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,177
Shuck the corn? Season the meat?

418
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:29,813
Mow the lawn.

419
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,315
Um, what?

420
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:33,684
And clean the gutters, rotate my tires,

421
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:36,220
grout the tub, and empty the dishwasher.

422
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,122
Dude.

423
00:17:38,124 --> 00:17:41,325
What does that have to do with barbecuing?

424
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:43,093
I thought you came here to learn.

425
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,828
Let me go get the lawn mower.

426
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,096
( Door opens )

427
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:47,765
I knew exactly what Diggie was doing.

428
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,734
Using barbecue to soften up the old man?

429
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,103
If he wanted to get on my good side,

430
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:54,605
he was going to have to get on the good side

431
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,408
of my to-do list.

432
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,344
Finally, a little thrilla on the grilla!

433
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:03,147
All those chores made me hungry.

434
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:05,282
( Snaps )

435
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,084
That's mine.

436
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,521
What... did you forget to bring your own steak?

437
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,858
Maybe next time.

438
00:18:18,496 --> 00:18:19,863
Next time?

439
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:22,800
I'm in! ( Laughs )

440
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,102
- ( Sizzles ) - Aah!

441
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,838
"Bring your own steak." Classic!

442
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,143
Why are you messing with that poor boy?

443
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:36,146
I'm just making sure he's good enough for my daughter.

444
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,148
And I'm done for the day.

445
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,851
Don't tell Maddie,

446
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,153
but except for that stupid name,

447
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,189
Diggie's all right.
