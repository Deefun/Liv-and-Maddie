157
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,443
Oh! Hey, Liv, you want some chocolate pudding?

158
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,445
We found a big bowl of it in the fridge.

159
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,814
Um, boys, that's not chocolate pudding.

160
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,049
That's my organic face mask from Paris.

161
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,985
Oh, ho ho ho.

162
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,754
Fancy pudding.

163
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,956
Yeah. It's made with orangutan poop.

164
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,693
( Sputters )

165
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,063
Well, whatever that monkey ate was delicious.

166
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,835
Is that banana?

167
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,403
Okay, just...

168
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,805
Eww, Joey...

169
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,840
( clears throat )

170
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,141
Get this.

171
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,010
Somehow word has spread through the blogosphere

172
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,512
that I'm up for the role of Tristan in "Space Werewolves."

173
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,182
Not sure how that info leaked out onto the Internet.

174
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,451
We would never post that juicy tidbit

175
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,221
on the Stevens Point "Space Werewolves" fan page

176
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,556
in hopes of enraging local Tristanites.

177
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,791
( Laughs )

178
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,761
Liv will thank me for this later.

179
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,462
Let me guess.

180
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,564
The fanboys were none too pleased

181
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,566
about you playing Tristan.

182
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,968
You probably want to throw in the towel

183
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,070
and back out.

184
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,505
Uh, no.

185
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,973
I mean, why do I care what nerd nation

186
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,977
Because we are a powerful force to be reckoned with...

187
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,579
I mean, they are!

188
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,914
( Clears throat ) Whatever.

189
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,616
This weekend I have a personal appearance

190
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,751
at Neville's Novelty Shoppe to sign "Sing it Loud!" DVDs.

191
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,019
Why don't you guys come with me?

192
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,490
Liv, Neville's is fanboy central.

193
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,061
and then find out that you don't know what you're talking about

194
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,562
they will eat you alive.

195
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,632
He's a werewolf and he lives in space.

196
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,600
I think anything else I need to learn about him will be in here.

197
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,869
I can probably finish this by Saturday, yeah?

198
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,104
Liv, that's volume 1.

199
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,940
There are 64 volumes.

200
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,141
Hah!

201
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,910
No wonder they're making this into a movie.

202
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,778
Who would want to read all that?
