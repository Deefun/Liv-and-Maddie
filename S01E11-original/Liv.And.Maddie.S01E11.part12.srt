448
00:18:49,127 --> 00:18:50,794
Final question, girl.

449
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,898
When Tristan split the galactic pangaea,

450
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,835
what did he say to the scattering colonies?

451
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:02,306
"Run to the stars, wolves.

452
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,541
- ( Mouthing along ) - But always put first your families.

453
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:05,876
For their love

454
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,145
keeps you tethered to the universe."

455
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,716
( Sighs ) Wow. You've gotta admit...

456
00:19:12,718 --> 00:19:14,618
Maddie's making Liv look really good.

457
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:16,453
She's not fooling anyone.

458
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,456
Well, except everyone here.

459
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:24,728
Well, Liv Rooney...

460
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,930
I'm sold.

461
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:31,568
I mean, you will make a great Tristan Lycanth.

462
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:35,706
All hail the she-Tristan!

463
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,942
( Howling loudly )

464
00:19:38,944 --> 00:19:40,878
And, FYI...

465
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,181
I currently am available for le prom.

466
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:47,484
( Chuckles, roars )

467
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,919
But your window of opportunity

468
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,822
is closing.

469
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,323
Boop!

470
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:54,725
Artie.

471
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,527
Are you serious?

472
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,496
You can accept my sister playing Tristan?

473
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:01,865
What part of... ( Howls loudly )

474
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,333
Don't you understand?

475
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,904
Okay, so Parker and I are the only ones

476
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:08,839
that have a problem with this?

477
00:20:08,841 --> 00:20:10,474
Um, speak for yourself.

478
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,875
She won me over too.

479
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,579
Artie, tail me.

480
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:21,985
( Singing stately tune )

481
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,289
( Howls )

482
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,958
( Howling )

483
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,294
It was at that moment that I realized

484
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,929
I was the crazy fanboy

485
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,597
that I was trying to protect Liv from.

486
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:35,933
I was untethered from my family.

487
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,901
I was the lone wolf.

488
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,239
And I should not have eaten 15 gummy eyeballs.

489
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,608
You know what, Artie...

490
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:46,977
tail me too.

491
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:53,517
All hail the she-Tristan!
