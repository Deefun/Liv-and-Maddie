326
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,165
Hey, check it out...

327
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,067
I sold Liv's toothbrush to a "Sing it Loud!" Fan

328
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,202
and got us a bunch of gummy eyeballs.

329
00:13:25,204 --> 00:13:26,937
( Mouths )

330
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:29,907
Too bad she only has one toothbrush.

331
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:33,944
Oh, please... I picked that one off the sidewalk out front.

332
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,215
Oh...

333
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,120
The switch-a-Rooney was on.

334
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,955
It took me four hours to do my hair

335
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,991
and Liv made me sleep with my head hanging off the mattress

336
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:48,459
to protect the pouf.

337
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,894
( Snorts )

338
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,363
I drooled into my own nose.

339
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,938
( Cheering )

340
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,407
( Scattered applause )

341
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,846
( Object shatters )

342
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:13,250
Thank you all so much for coming

343
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:15,586
to the season 4 DVD signing

344
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,922
of  Sing it Loud!

345
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:23,427
Artie's here.

346
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:26,364
Let the games begin.

347
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:27,898
Liv Rooney.

348
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,600
Are the rumors true that you,

349
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:33,170
a girl, might play Tristan Lycanth?

350
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:34,572
( Clicks, drops pen )

351
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,041
It's true, fanboy.

352
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,342
What say you?

353
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,912
I say it's intergalactic blasphemy!

354
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,914
And I shall prove you're unworthy.

355
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,884
Be warned my minions are live blogging.

356
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,421
King_Artie_the_magnificent @ wolfspot dot howl.

357
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,555
Ha ha.

358
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,158
Bring it on, king Artie.

359
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:58,195
Speak for Tristan's lineage.

360
00:15:00,031 --> 00:15:01,599
Who are his parents?

361
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:07,204
Liv is about to go down in flames.

362
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,606
His parents

363
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,275
are the werewolf Magrol

364
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,411
and queen Zira.

365
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,046
Bam! What?!

366
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:20,117
( Laughs )

367
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,021
I mean, space-tastic question.

368
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:25,556
( Laughs )

369
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,092
Both: Maddie.
