203
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,917
Ugh!

204
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,685
Ugh!

205
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,022
323 pages

206
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,590
of "Rules of the Road,"

207
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,825
and not once did they admit

208
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,593
that turning left into oncoming traffic

209
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,595
is insane.

210
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,666
420 pages of werewolves and spaceships,

211
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,934
and the only thing I'm really looking is that

212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,761
I think I could totally rock Tristan's space suit.

213
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,871
Yeah...

214
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,840
just wait till they get to the Battle of Mirth.

215
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,874
( Imitates gunfire )

216
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,242
That's when he meets Kytra,

217
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,910
and that's when the adventure really kicks off.

218
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,278
( Gasps )

219
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,216
You undercover Sci-Fi geek.

220
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,552
You've totally read this book.

221
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,987
Yeah, I've actually read them all.

222
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,789
I love them. And I have to admit...

223
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,792
I am a little on the fence about you playing Tristan myself.

224
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,595
Okay... one, how dare you.

225
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,232
And two, help me.

226
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,734
Okay, Liv, why are you wigging out?

227
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,636
Because I really want this role.

228
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,937
I mean, I know that I've been playing it cool,

229
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,939
but this is way bigger than my show

230
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,176
and it could send me into a completely new acting stratosphere.

231
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,279
I just have no idea how to impress these fanboys.

232
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,781
Okay, well, I would love to help you

233
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,682
but, Liv, my driver's test is on the same day

234
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,984
as your autograph signing.

235
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,185
And I still have no idea

236
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,587
how to make a stupid left-hand turn.

237
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,624
I have a twin-sane idea!

238
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,028
This Saturday, I'll be you and you be me.

239
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,696
- Wait, you mean like... - A switch-a-Rooney.

240
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,131
( Both scream )

241
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,868
I'll face your fanboys.

242
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,737
And I will take your driver's test.

243
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,639
Perfect! ( Laughs )

244
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,274
Why is this bed so squishy?

245
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,746
( Clears throat )

246
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,950
Because I am sitting on a pizza.

247
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,053
A girl gets hungry at 3:00 A.M.
