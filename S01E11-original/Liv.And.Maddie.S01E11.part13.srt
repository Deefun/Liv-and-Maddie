493
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,026
Let me make one thing clear.

494
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,562
This was the last switch-a-Rooney.

495
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,930
You did it when you were 6.

496
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,332
And I wrote your names on your forehead

497
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,034
in permanent marker.

498
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,871
Don't make me do that again.

499
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,741
Ah, yes... the summer of headbands.

500
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,611
To be fair, though, we rocked the headband look.

501
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,479
( Laughs )

502
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,947
Ha ha fun fun.

503
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,950
Maddie, no license till you're 17.

504
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,952
Rock that look.

505
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,356
17?! Seriously?

506
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,557
You want to make it 18?

507
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,659
Ah, 17. Looking forward to it.

508
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,795
And Liv,

509
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,429
since you like driving so much,

510
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,331
you are now my personal chauffeur until further notice.

511
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,667
- No! - ( Laughing ) Yes.

512
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,472
There is no errand too small, no trip too far.

513
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,641
I might even have you take me down to the end of the driveway

514
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,909
just to get the newspaper.

515
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,811
I don't know.

516
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,480
That's right, girls.

517
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,749
I just dropped an atomic mom bomb.

518
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,017
Boom!

519
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,825
She can't be serious about that, right?

520
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,626
Do we seriously still get newspapers

521
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,862
delivered to our house?

522
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,399
Hey, whatever you did down at Neville's totally worked.

523
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,035
Some fanboy named lone wolf started a petition

524
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,837
to get me the role of Tristan.

525
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,072
You won over the fanboys.

526
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,507
Thank you.

527
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,044
Pretty sure lone wolf is actually lone Joey.

528
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,547
You should go thank him.

529
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,015
Wait, I thought you said that Joey

530
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,817
was the one trying to sabotage us.

531
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,120
It was a long and complicated day.

532
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,623
Got it.

533
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,960
Also I'm sorry about wrecking your driver's test.

534
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,029
Literally. Ha!

535
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,065
And I got you something.

536
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,837
You might want to return this to the... hoovers.

537
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,840
Thanks.

538
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,141
That reminds me.

539
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,811
I got you something as well.

540
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,013
One of Artie's wolf tails. Yeah.

541
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,618
Oh! Also I got you a date to the prom.

542
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,987
( Laughs ) Yeah.

543
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,422
Artie would like to know what kind of dress

544
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,926
you will be wearing... Wizard or Pegasus?
