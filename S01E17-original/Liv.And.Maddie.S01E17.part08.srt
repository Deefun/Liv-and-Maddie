270
00:13:25,325 --> 00:13:26,659
(Both growl)

271
00:13:28,729 --> 00:13:31,597
- Sick beat. - Super tight.

272
00:13:34,601 --> 00:13:35,668
So...

273
00:13:35,703 --> 00:13:37,537
The two of you have gone from breakdancing

274
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:39,472
to sharing ear buds.

275
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,374
(Snorts) That is so cute.

276
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:47,613
Q-pop says you gotta dare to share.

277
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:50,583
Yeah. Speaking of sharing, I haven't really seen you much lately.

278
00:13:50,617 --> 00:13:52,518
Do you want to go grab some fro-yo after school?

279
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:56,322
Oh, I'd love to, but we have a breaking lesson tonight.

280
00:13:56,356 --> 00:13:58,758
Check out these funky fresh moves.

281
00:14:00,327 --> 00:14:02,261
- Ready, Joseph? - So ready, digs.

282
00:14:02,296 --> 00:14:04,597
(Exhales) Five, six, both: Seven, eight.

283
00:14:04,631 --> 00:14:06,432
What? Yeah!

284
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,267
Some of this? Oh, oh!

285
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:09,435
Both: And down to the ground.

286
00:14:10,704 --> 00:14:12,271
Uh!

287
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:13,339
Beam me up!

288
00:14:13,373 --> 00:14:14,474
(Imitates whirring)

289
00:14:16,477 --> 00:14:17,510
(Grunts)

290
00:14:17,544 --> 00:14:19,278
- What up? - Fist bump.

291
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:21,614
Both: Good sesh.
