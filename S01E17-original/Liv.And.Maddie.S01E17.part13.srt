448
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:17,423
Oh, this tension is killing me.

449
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:19,892
Our little baby could be a movie star.

450
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,461
Not could be. Will be.

451
00:22:22,495 --> 00:22:23,762

452
00:22:23,797 --> 00:22:25,764
She just pulled up.

453
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:29,435
Okay, everybody just act normal.

454
00:22:32,639 --> 00:22:34,440
Okay...

455
00:22:34,474 --> 00:22:35,574
More normal than that.

456
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:41,330
Hey guys.

457
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:42,585
(Door closes)

458
00:22:42,705 --> 00:22:44,365
Oh no.

459
00:22:44,607 --> 00:22:47,368
Oh well, who can beat Gosling and Diesel?

460
00:22:47,488 --> 00:22:48,869
Yeah.

461
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,654

462
00:22:51,672 --> 00:22:52,706

463
00:22:52,757 --> 00:22:53,757
I'm gonna be Tristan Lycanth.

464
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,009
(All cheer) This is amazing news!

465
00:22:57,678 --> 00:22:58,712
Let's celebrate!

466
00:22:58,763 --> 00:22:59,996

467
00:23:00,014 --> 00:23:01,848

468
00:23:01,883 --> 00:23:03,683

469
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:05,052
- I need to... - Guys, guys?

470
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:07,020
I really really really appreciate that,

471
00:23:07,055 --> 00:23:09,940
but I'm pretty wiped out from the audition,

472
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,975
so I think I'm just gonna go to bed.

473
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:13,610

474
00:23:18,983 --> 00:23:19,950
