152
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,634
Okay, here we go.

153
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:56,306
Okay, this is just frozen mustard.

154
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,576
But from where?

155
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:07,117
A light yellow dijon originally crafted in France

156
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:11,288
but now manufactured in Kentucky...

157
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:12,289
Dipped once...

158
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,490
no.

159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,460
Twice!

160
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,496
In hot dog water.

161
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:22,499
Ah.

162
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,534
Inspiring.

163
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:26,303
(Doorbell rings)

164
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:28,505
Fangs is here! Fangs is here.

165
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,207
Ooh, the girl from the book?

166
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,142
Yeah. You guys were right.

167
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:34,544
I've realized that if I want this part I have to do something really big,

168
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:39,282
so I hired fangs to help me tap into my inner wolf.

169
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,152
Delivery for Liv Rooney?

170
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,187
- Sign here. - Okay.

171
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,156
Oh.

172
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,625
That's so weird. Maybe fangs had all her bags shipped here?

173
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:50,527
(Chuckles)

174
00:08:53,197 --> 00:08:54,164
(Growls)

175
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,335
Is that fangs?

176
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,471
No, munch, it's a different girl who was raised by wolves.

177
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:05,342
Hello, fangs!

178
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,476
Me Liv!

179
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,146
(Sniffs)

180
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,448
I read this in her book.

181
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,383
She has to get used to the smell of new people.

182
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,454
Your scent is acceptable.

183
00:09:21,158 --> 00:09:22,292
(Sighs)

184
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,294
Sorry about the cage.

185
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:28,531
My wolf instincts are strong, and I don't trust myself around new humans.

186
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,203
Plus, it's cheaper to travel in cargo.

187
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,307
Well, fangs, these are my brothers.

188
00:09:38,342 --> 00:09:39,342
(Yelps)

189
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:40,510
(Sniffs)

190
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,482
(Squeals)

191
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,319
Not gonna lie, I'm into this.

192
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,158
Glad you called, Rooney.

193
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:57,160
I never miss a chance to make sure wolves

194
00:09:57,194 --> 00:10:00,163
are accurately portrayed in the media.

195
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:03,500
Well, then, if anyone asks, I will proudly state for the record

196
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:07,170
that you did not eat my grandma or blow my house down. (Chuckles)

197
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,338
See, that right there?

198
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:09,339
Offensive.

199
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,176
Let's begin.

200
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,245
Tristan Lycanth is half-wolf.

201
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,549
Wolves are majestic, fierce creatures.

202
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,251
You got any wolf in you, Rooney?

203
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:24,287
Um, no. No, she does not.

204
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,489
Live she sniffed my pits.

205
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,491
I can't lie to her.

206
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,360
Howl for me.

207
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,529
It's the most important part about being a wolf.

208
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:34,564
It asserts your dominance.

209
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:38,568
Well, my howl is dom-alicious.

210
00:10:40,705 --> 00:10:42,372
(Growls)

211
00:10:42,406 --> 00:10:45,375
(Howls, vocalizes)

212
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,283
Rooney, we have work to do.

213
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,517
What?

214
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:57,654
You're gonna live like a wolf, hunt like a wolf, eat like a wolf

215
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,622
and poop like a wolf.

216
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,158
Oh, I can show her the last one.

217
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:10,333
Yeah, I can imitate the pooping styles of 84 different animal species.

218
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:14,170
Your offer of a poop demo is appreciated, little man.

219
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,239
But Liv's my student now.

220
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,408
Welcome to my wolf pack.

221
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:20,477
(Gasps)

222
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,446
This is gonna be so awesome.
