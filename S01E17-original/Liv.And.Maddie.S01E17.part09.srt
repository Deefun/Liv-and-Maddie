292
00:14:30,324 --> 00:14:31,457
(Both growl, sniff)

293
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:39,298
Great training sesh this morning, fangs.

294
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,334
It was so much fun chasing ducks.

295
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,302
Tell me about it.

296
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,471
They've had it too good for too long.

297
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,474
I think we've earned lunch.

298
00:14:54,348 --> 00:14:55,414
(Both growl)

299
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:01,621
(Gasps) Eating off the floor.

300
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:04,557
Were you raised by wolves?

301
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,392
Mom.

302
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,560
Oh, sorry sorry.

303
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,562
Sorry sorry sorry.

304
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,269
Thanks for training with me so hard this week, fangs.

305
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,437
I am going to nail this audition.

306
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,573
That part is so mine, am I right?

307
00:15:20,607 --> 00:15:22,475
(Growls)

308
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:28,381
When the wolf is silent, the wolf disapproves.

309
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:29,382
What's wrong?

310
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:34,387
As good as you're doing, the only way you're gonna nail that audition

311
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,389
is if you nail your howl.

312
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,391
It is the heart and soul of any wolf.

313
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:42,595
(Howls)

314
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,331
(Dogs barking) Wow, I...

315
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:48,501
Think you scared every dog in the neighborhood.

316
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:49,635
No.

317
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,572
There's a doberman on the next block who didn't reply.

318
00:15:52,606 --> 00:15:55,374
(Howls)

319
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:56,609
(Dog barks)

320
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,744
There he is.

321
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,379
He apologized.

322
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:03,316
You can't pee and bark at the same time.

323
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,585
Okay, Rooney. Your turn.

324
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,686
Okay.

325
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,588
(Growls)

326
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:11,257
(Howls)

327
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,593
(Vocalizes "Amazing Grace")

328
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,266
Quit goofing around.

329
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,435
You're not taking your howl seriously.

330
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,337
You know what?

331
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,371
I'm out.

332
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,606
What?

333
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,442
You can't be out. We're in a pack.

334
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:31,344
You licked my face.

335
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:33,679
I'm sorry, Rooney.

336
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:35,448
We've gone as far as we can go.

337
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:39,518
Plus, I'm itchy and your mom won't let me drag my butt on your carpet.

338
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:43,289
You know what? Fine.

339
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:46,459
I am going to be an awesome Tristan without your help.

340
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,294
Oh, you want this?

341
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:49,462
Mmm. Yeah?

342
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,630
Yeah, I know you want it.

343
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,498
Yum yum, right?

344
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:53,633
Go get it!

345
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,301
(Panting)

346
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,409
(Sighs) Stupid wolf.
