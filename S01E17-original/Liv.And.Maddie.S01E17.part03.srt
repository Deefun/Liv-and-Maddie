57
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,649
- Hey. - Hey. You keep saying

58
00:02:32,684 --> 00:02:34,217
you want to do couple-y things

59
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:36,420
now that we're officially in like?

60
00:02:36,454 --> 00:02:38,422
Well, it's mostly been you that's been saying that,

61
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:41,191
but you're really cute when you talk, so continue.

62
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:44,428
Well, I signed us up for dance lessons.

63
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:45,596
Ooh.

64
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,264
That could be romantic.

65
00:02:47,298 --> 00:02:49,600
What kind? Saa, tango, waltz?

66
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,235
Breakdanng!

67
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,204
(Laughs)

68
00:02:54,238 --> 00:02:55,505
(Snorts) Breakdancing?

69
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,207
- Yeah. - (Chuckles)

70
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:59,509
Um, Diggie, that's not couple-y.

71
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,278
Oh, mads, you're so wrong.

72
00:03:01,312 --> 00:03:04,414
My wave could connect right to your wave.

73
00:03:06,184 --> 00:03:07,150
What!

74
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:10,253
Ah, chain wave.

75
00:03:10,288 --> 00:03:12,589
Give me some of that.

76
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:14,491
(Whooshing)

77
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:21,498
Sorry, guys. Breaking's just not really my thing.

78
00:03:21,532 --> 00:03:24,368
It's hard to believe we're even related.

79
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:29,306
Um, well... hey, here's an idea.

80
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,342
You guys both seem really excited about this,

81
00:03:32,377 --> 00:03:35,212
so why don't you take the lessons together?

82
00:03:35,246 --> 00:03:40,617
And then Diggie, you and I can figure out something that we both want to do.

83
00:03:42,553 --> 00:03:45,355
We are breaking bros now.

84
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,390
Chain wave.

85
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,393
(Both whooshing)

86
00:03:54,432 --> 00:03:56,366
Yeah yeah, that was nice.

87
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,534
Now let me show you my wave.

88
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,602
Buh-bye.
