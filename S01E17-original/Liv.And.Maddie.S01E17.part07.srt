223
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,443
And if you need the restroom, it's just back that way.

224
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:31,611
Nah.

225
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,447
Marked my territory on your porch before I came in.

226
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:37,317
Ooh, got an itch.

227
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,585
Can't get it. Can't get it.

228
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:39,586
- Can't get it. - Okay.

229
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,421
Help a wolf out!

230
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:42,655
Oh!

231
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,724
(Murmurs) (Chuckles)

232
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,593
Ahh, that's the stuff.

233
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:48,328
Yeah?

234
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,663
Wolf girl is cray cray.

235
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:53,433
But she is going to give me the forest cred

236
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,801
that I need to really nail this audition.

237
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:58,404
(Chuckles) Scrape that off the road and eat it, Gosling.

238
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:02,642
This is from the forest where my wolf family raised me.

239
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:05,578
Lots of good stink to roll around in.

240
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:06,579
Oh!

241
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:10,550
Ah.

242
00:12:10,584 --> 00:12:12,452
(Gasps)

243
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,657
Ahh.

244
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,527
Your turn, wolf pup.

245
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:23,329
Get up in it.

246
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:24,497
(Clears throat) Okay.

247
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:25,665
(Chuckles)

248
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,469
Whoo.

249
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,638
Look at me.

250
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:35,308
Scooting around in the filth.

251
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:36,576
Whoo.

252
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,644
Like an animal.

253
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:39,312
I am wild!

254
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,316
- Rooney... - Yeah?

255
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,684
- Can I get real for a minute? - Mm-hmm?

256
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:48,554
If you want to ace this audition, you have to go full wolf.

257
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,490
Wolves are territorial animals.

258
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,557
- Yeah. - They take what's theirs,

259
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,593
and they don't back down. - Yeah.

260
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:54,761
Let's try something else.

261
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,529
What?

262
00:12:58,532 --> 00:12:59,565
You want it?

263
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,533
Take it.

264
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,369
- Okay. - (Growls)

265
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,438
(Gasps)

266
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:07,273
(Growls)

267
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:08,274
(Sighs)

268
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:10,610
(Both growling)

269
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:25,291
I'm gonna go get the hose.
