1
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:04,503
Okay. Take a sip.

2
00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:07,173
You will never guess what's in this one.

3
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:18,184
Skim milk, avocado, peanut butter, a hint of zit puss,

4
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:25,424
celery juice and half a chewed-up chicken nugget.

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,196
I have said it before, and I will say it again.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,397
Amazing.

7
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:33,432
Boys boys boys boys boys boys.

8
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:34,533
(Squeals)

9
00:00:34,568 --> 00:00:36,635
Set your phasers to excitement.

10
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,504
Okay.

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,539
The producers of "space werewolves" just called.

12
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:44,376
There are apparently only three actors still in the running for the lead,

13
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:45,544
and I'm one of them!

14
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,213
Both: Whoo!

15
00:00:47,247 --> 00:00:49,315
(All shout)

16
00:00:49,349 --> 00:00:50,516
"Space werewolves"

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,553
is the greatest Sci-Fi graphic novel ever.

18
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:59,525
It is the epic tale of Tristan Lycanth, half-wolf, half-human,

19
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:02,328
and his battle to save his planet.

20
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:06,165
It is like "star wars" and "lord of t rings" had a baby,

21
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:09,501
and then "the avengers" adopted it.

22
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:13,339
Tristan is the baddest dude in the galaxy.

23
00:01:13,373 --> 00:01:16,408
But if Liv gets the part, they're gonna change him to a her.

24
00:01:16,443 --> 00:01:18,510
And then the baddest dude in the galaxy

25
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,179
will be...

26
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,347
My sister.

27
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,582
Guys, my final audition is in a week.

28
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:26,318
This is the part that could make me a movie star.

29
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:28,354
Unbelievable.

30
00:01:28,388 --> 00:01:31,357
My sister is gonna be Tristan Lycanth.

31
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,659
Who are the two losers you're up against?

32
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,361
Ryan Gosling and Vin Diesel.

33
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:36,395
Both: Ohh!
