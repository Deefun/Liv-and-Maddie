121
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,511
Whoa.

122
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:59,189
(Dance music stops) That was awesome, qpop.

123
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:02,159
Yeah, q-pop don't stop.

124
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,393
Oh.

125
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:04,494
(Beats)

126
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:18,141
Mc j-town in da house.

127
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:23,480
Mc j-town be his own boy.

128
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:24,481
Respect!

129
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,386
Joey, this is q-pop.

130
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,487
He's our dance instructor.

131
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,190
Oh, well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. pop.

132
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:37,327
My mission is to get fresh, stay fresh, then refresh.

133
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:42,566
I just dropped my motto on this grotto.

134
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,367
(Grunts)

135
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,269
This is so cool.

136
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,504
I can't believe Maddie bailed.

137
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:48,638
I feel so alive.

138
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:53,477
Her loss is the breaking bros' gain.

139
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,345
Plus, who knew I lived in a grotto.

140
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,546
Right?

141
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,216
All right. Let's see what y'all are working with.

142
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
Time to get fresh, y'all.

143
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:04,254
When I drop the beat, I want to see you robot.

144
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,591
(Dance music playing)

145
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:12,562
Oh... no.

146
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,270
Gentlemen, are y'all trying to make q-pop cry?

147
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,309
All right, let's try to back it up to a simpler move, okay?

148
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,146
This one is called "finding the beat!"

149
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,317
(Snaps fingers)

150
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,625
Okay, wait. Slow down.

151
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,461
How are you making that noise with your fingers?
