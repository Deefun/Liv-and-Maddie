347
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,412
(Whimpers)

348
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,825
Yes, yes, no, book it, hate it, orange... Who is this?!

349
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,462
- Liv Rooney, superstar. - Hi.

350
00:17:23,497 --> 00:17:24,830
Been dying to meet the girl who's got the nerve

351
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,766
to go up against Ryan Gosling and Vin diesel.

352
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:29,702
We are dying to see what you have for us today.

353
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:31,504
(Bell rings)

354
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:32,705
Now remember, the most important thing

355
00:17:32,739 --> 00:17:34,707
is that big howl at the end of your speech.

356
00:17:34,741 --> 00:17:35,841
Really let loose.

357
00:17:35,876 --> 00:17:37,576
Take all the time you need to get ready.

358
00:17:37,611 --> 00:17:38,744
I don't want to rush you.

359
00:17:38,778 --> 00:17:39,778
And action!

360
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:42,648
This was it.

361
00:17:42,682 --> 00:17:45,618
This was my chance to become a movie star.

362
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:51,790
By the sting of my proton whip, I will bring you to your knees,

363
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,859
for I am your doom.

364
00:17:53,894 --> 00:17:55,861
I am wolf.

365
00:17:55,896 --> 00:17:59,465
I am Tristan Lycanth.

366
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,368
And?!

367
00:18:04,404 --> 00:18:06,438
Oh, right. And scene. (Giggles)

368
00:18:06,473 --> 00:18:08,541
No, where was my howl?

369
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:09,842
I need to hear a howl.

370
00:18:09,876 --> 00:18:12,511
Let's try it again from the top.

371
00:18:12,546 --> 00:18:14,780
Okay. (Clears throat)

372
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:19,385
Um, just to be clear, though, this is gonna be without the howl?

373
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:21,387
With the howl.

374
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,588
Right.
