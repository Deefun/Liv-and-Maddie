375
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:26,625
When you two marshmallows first stepped up to the mat,

376
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,461
I was like "breakdancing is gonna roast them alive."

377
00:18:29,496 --> 00:18:30,796
(Both scoff)

378
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,566
But I've been spitting a little knowledge to you two,

379
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,867
and you all have soaked it up.

380
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,577
Mix master Maddie in the house!

381
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,545
Joey: Yeah.

382
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,780
Maddie, what are you doing here?

383
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,848
Diggie, I realized that...

384
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,584
Being a part of a couple

385
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,652
means sometimes doing things that the other person likes.

386
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,556
So I met up with q-pop earlier, and he taught me a couple moves.

387
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,694
I figure if I can't beat 'em, break 'em.

388
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:04,730
Oh, and if you can't break 'em, breakdance.

389
00:19:04,764 --> 00:19:05,731
(Mouthing)

390
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,806
Seriously, Maddie, breakdancing is mc j-town and dig-dog's thing... whoa!

391
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,374
(Clears throat)

392
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:16,408
Cue it, pop.

393
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:17,743
Oh, that's how I do!

394
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:19,478
(Dance music playing)

395
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,736
And that is how I do.

396
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:47,740
Yeah, okay. Beat it, Joey.

397
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,410
(Beatboxing)

398
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:55,848
The other "beat it."

399
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,416
I know.
