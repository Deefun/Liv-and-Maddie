177
00:09:14,757 --> 00:09:18,042
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?

178
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:21,484
Ho ho ho, who wouldn't go?

179
00:09:21,485 --> 00:09:24,413
Up on the housetop click click click.

180
00:09:24,414 --> 00:09:28,149
Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick.

181
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,316
[Squeals]

182
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:32,677
Jenny, that was so great.

183
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:36,736
That means everything coming from you, Liv.

184
00:09:36,737 --> 00:09:39,408
Well between this duet and Liv's solo,

185
00:09:39,409 --> 00:09:42,700
this is going to be the best tree lighting ceremony ever.

186
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:46,745
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Rooney, for your wonderful flute playing.

187
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:52,206
It's like listening to beauty share a hug with Grace.

188
00:09:52,306 --> 00:09:54,192
Well, thank you, Jenny.

189
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:57,881
You know, I was a bit of a triple threat in high school myself.

190
00:09:57,882 --> 00:10:01,942
Flute, baton twirling, and flag spinning.

191
00:10:01,943 --> 00:10:05,183
Pep squad in the house.

192
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:09,160
Once you've mastered the flag twirl...

193
00:10:09,161 --> 00:10:10,926
You never forget.

194
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:13,421
It's in my bones.

195
00:10:13,422 --> 00:10:15,853
Well, I'm gonna go check on dinner.

196
00:10:15,854 --> 00:10:19,100
Now you girls keep practicing. You sound great.

197
00:10:19,101 --> 00:10:22,248
Aw. Everyone sounds great when they're singing with Liv.

198
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:24,409
[Giggles]

199
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:27,756
Because you sound like a dying walrus.

200
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:29,977
[Chuckles]

201
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:31,489
You are just too sweet.

202
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,313
Wait, what?

203
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,738
Listen up, blondie.

204
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:38,520
I'm making some changes starting with this stupid outfit.

205
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:42,992
I'm the star of the show. I should have the cool dress!

206
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:44,595
Um...

207
00:10:44,596 --> 00:10:48,081
I'm pretty sure I'm the star of the show. I am the one lighting the tree,

208
00:10:48,082 --> 00:10:51,113
oh, and also I'm the one who had her own hit TV show.

209
00:10:51,114 --> 00:10:56,618
If you try to steal my spotlight, I will chew you up and spit you out.

210
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:59,019
Mrs. Rooney.

211
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:04,526
Could you drive me home? I promised Mommy I'd read to grandpa tonight.

212
00:11:04,527 --> 00:11:06,795
Well, you are just too good to be true.

213
00:11:06,796 --> 00:11:09,578
Sure, I was just gonna get some things for dinner. Let's go.

214
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,143
Not before I get a hug from Liv.

215
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:13,522
[Giggles]

216
00:11:13,523 --> 00:11:16,223
Watch your back.
