307
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:12,821
I don't know when you and Jenny worked out that comedy routine, but it was hysterical.

308
00:16:12,822 --> 00:16:14,125
[Laughs]

309
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:17,038
No, that wasn't planned. She was trying to destroy me.

310
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,015
[Snorts] Come on, Liv. That sweet little girl was not trying to destroy you.

311
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:26,649
Did you all not just see the candy cane beat down?

312
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,820
She was doing absolutely everything she could to make me look bad.

313
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,956
Give her a break, Liv.

314
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,945
Do you not remember how you were at her age?

315
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:37,726
I was not a monster like that.

316
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:42,818
- I have to go get wardrobe. - Got to work on that tree.

317
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,799
- [Camera shutter clicks] - [Sighs]

318
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,080
Ho ho ho.

319
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:52,843
So you are the last kid on Santa's lap.

320
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,194
What are you gonna do?

321
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,858
Pee on me, spit in my face,

322
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:58,683
pour itching powder down my suit, throw my glasses in the bushes?

323
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,464
I have seen it all today, kid.

324
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,991
Just pick one and do it quick.

325
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:08,032
[Blows]

326
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,133
Blowing your nose in my beard was not an option.

327
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:15,774
Get off of me.

328
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,802
[Groans]

329
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,191
Parker, there you are.

330
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:25,252
Here's 10 bucks. Add it to the pot. How much did we end up with?

331
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:30,265
Including the 10 bucks, that would be... [mouths]

332
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,486
10 bucks.

333
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:37,310
What? They've been handing you money all afternoon. Where did it go?

334
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:41,059
I'm sorry. I meant 10 bucks and this.

335
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,820
[Helicopter whirs]

336
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,705
One Screaming Dragon helicopter.

337
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:57,709
You used all of our Santa money and bought yourself the helicopter?

338
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,639
I also paid kids to pee on you, spit in your face,

339
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,540
pour itching powder down your suit, and throw your glasses into the bushes.

340
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:07,807
Why?

341
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:11,691
Because Mom was gonna get that helicopter for me until you wrecked my dream.

342
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,419
Welcome to Christmas revenge.

343
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,960
Ho-ho-how you like me now?

344
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:23,531
The only reason I did this Santa stand was so I could pay off your Christmas present.

345
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:25,746
[Grunts]

346
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:28,956
I talked Mom out of getting you that helicopter...

347
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:32,917
Because I already got it for you.

348
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:37,014
I'm sorry, munch. I had no idea you cared.

349
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,253
Me either. I guess it's just the Christmas spirit.

350
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,414
Come on.

351
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:49,911
Are you hugging me because you love me, or because you're covered in kid pee?

352
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:53,392
Mm, why can't it be both?
