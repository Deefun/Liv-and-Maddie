257
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,781
Run along now. Merry Christmas.

258
00:13:28,782 --> 00:13:33,319
I have to hand it to you, setting up right next to the park was genius.

259
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,309
Why don't you run over there and round up some more customers, my good Elf?

260
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,610
You got it, Mr. Kringle.

261
00:13:41,341 --> 00:13:47,241
Oh, how I wanted to shove fake snow in that stupid jolly face of his.

262
00:13:47,277 --> 00:13:49,492
But first, I was gonna mess with him.

263
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:52,804
And frankly, the tips were great.

264
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:55,205
Whoa-ho-ho!

265
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:59,363
Santa's lap is not a toilet.

266
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:02,713
That is like the fifth kid to do that.

267
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:04,983
What is going on here?

268
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:06,567
Free apple cider.

269
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:12,468
Remember, you cannot get on Santa's lap until you drink every last drop.
