219
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,016
Oh.

220
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,672
That girl is such an Angel. She insisted that I give you these cookies.

221
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:32,333
[Gasps] Mom! Don't eat those.

222
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:37,607
Now I know we watch our carbs around the holidays, but what was that?

223
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:39,608
Jenny Keene is a monster.

224
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,431
Yeah.

225
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:43,829
One minute it's "beauty sharing a hug with Grace".

226
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,030
And the next it's "watch your back".

227
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:51,232
Honey, that can't be true.

228
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,784
During the ride home, she sang me "the 12 days of Christmas"...

229
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:56,856
Complimented my shoes, and offered me gas money.

230
00:11:56,857 --> 00:12:01,091
Ha! She's a liar. Your shoes are hideous.

231
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,275
Honey...

232
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:08,176
Imagine how scared that little girl must be to share a spotlight with Liv Rooney.

233
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:12,831
Yeah. [Chuckles] I guess you're right.

234
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,972
Must be so cold there in my shadow.

235
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,178
Look, this is what being a mentor is all about.

236
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,895
That little girl needs your guidance.

237
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,861
I guess everybody gets nervous in different ways.

238
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:26,659
You know some people chew their fingernails,

239
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,854
and other people turn into a Demon spawn.

240
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:31,625
Well, let's cheer ourselves up.

241
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:36,925
We can watch the clip of your Dad freezing up on the news again.

242
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,766
- Merry Christmas. - [Both laugh]
