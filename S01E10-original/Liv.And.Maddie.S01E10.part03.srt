67
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:40,571
Oh, I am so excited that you're headlining channel four's holiday spectacular.

68
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:42,894
Partly because it's great for the town,

69
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:47,086
but mostly because I'd already told the committee you'd say yes.

70
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:49,111
I mean, how can I say no?

71
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,303
This is where it all began eight years ago.

72
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:56,328
My little baby's first time out on stage singing her little heart out.

73
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,131
I still remember how you wowed the crowd with "Frosty the Snowman".

74
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:03,199
And "White Christmas".

75
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,201
And "Little Drummer Boy".

76
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,721
By the time you'd finished "O Little Town of Bethlehem,"

77
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:12,271
I felt like I'd walked there myself.

78
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:14,362
I never wanted it to end.

79
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:16,978
And it almost didn't.

80
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:19,319
Liv Rooney?

81
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,961
Hi. I'm Jenny Keene.

82
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:25,361
Hi. You are the adorable little girl that I get

83
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,384
to share the stage with this Christmas Eve.

84
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:31,960
I watched your audition tape, and you have some serious pipes, young lady.

85
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:35,652
It feels so good to be talented, doesn't it?

86
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:39,581
I want to be just like you when I grow up.

87
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:42,066
Well, you are certainly on the right track.

88
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,034
Eight years ago, I was you.

89
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:48,597
I was a starry-eyed little girl, excited to make her first TV appearance.

90
00:04:48,598 --> 00:04:49,553
[Giggles]

91
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:52,763
And I mean, after this show, my life changed forever.

92
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:55,227
It's true. Without it, Liv never would have been cast

93
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,011
in a local commercial as Mandy, the singing muffler.

94
00:04:58,012 --> 00:04:59,245
[Clears throat]

95
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:02,380
Mandy says your muffler is a-okay.

96
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:03,996
- [Clicks teeth] - [Chuckles]

97
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:07,082
We still get a discount.

98
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,644
But I didn't really have anyone to guide me, so I wanted to be that for you.

99
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:14,107
You know, this industry can get kind of tough, and it's good to have a mentor.

100
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:18,743
I can't believe Liv Rooney's going to be my celebrity mentor.

101
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:20,893
Oh, stop. Celebrity mentor?

102
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:22,778
[Chuckles] You don't have to say that...

103
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:28,119
I mean, you definitely can. I'm not gonna stop you.
