00:12:45,478 --> 00:12:46,802
Status update, Dad?

245
00:12:46,803 --> 00:12:49,952
I've strung seven and a half miles of tree lights,

246
00:12:49,953 --> 00:12:52,744
hardwired her into the main power grid to the school,

247
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:56,816
and duct taped 19 power strips together.

248
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,715
[Grunts]

249
00:12:57,716 --> 00:13:00,154
- We are gonna blow the Griswolds away. - [Grunts]

250
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,538
Hey. Check out the awesome tree topper I found.

251
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,343
You... [chuckles]

252
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:08,404
You might need these.

253
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:12,951
Whoa.

254
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:19,667
Every superhero in the world is gonna report to Stevens Point this Christmas Eve.

255
00:13:19,668 --> 00:13:22,008
Go Rooneys.

256
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:25,470
[Grunts] Yeah.
