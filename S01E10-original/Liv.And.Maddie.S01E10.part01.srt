Hey, honey. Check out my latest innovation in tree decorating.

4
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:31,780
I built a base that turns the tree so you can decorate it easier.

5
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,561
I call it "The Tree-zy Susan".

6
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:39,922
Yep. After just three weeks in the wood shop,

7
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:44,922
Dad has shaved five minutes off our decorating time.

8
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:49,423
I finished my Christmas wish list, Mommy.

9
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:52,606
The trick to getting what you really want for Christmas

10
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:54,862
is to first ask for the impossible.

11
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:59,031
I throw in a "Mommy" or two to grease the wheels.

12
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:01,933
I only want one thing, Mommy.

13
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:04,768
Peace on earth, good will toward men.

14
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,072
[Sighs] Sorry, I guess that's two things.

15
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:12,808
Well, they're a little tough to wrap and put under the tree.

16
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,656
What else is on your list?

17
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:19,875
Well, I didn't think I'd need a backup, but I guess I could settle for...

18
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:22,209
The Screaming Dragon remote pilot helicopter

19
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,410
with a built-in 13-megapixel camera.

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,456
Well, they're kind of expensive.

21
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,427
But I think we can get you that helicopter.

22
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,395
That's how you get 'er done, son.

23
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:40,831
Oh, please. Letting Parker think he's "working us".

24
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,822
Has become a Christmas tradition.

25
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:46,504
Last year he asked us to fill in the hole in the ozone layer.

26
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,674
He got a bike.

27
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,403
Seriously? A helicopter?

28
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:53,661
He's just gonna break it in the first 15 minutes.

29
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:55,425
May as well flush your money down the toilet.

30
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,183
Oh, wait, you can't.

31
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:01,684
His remote control submarine already clogged it.

32
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,863
Mm, I hadn't thought about that.

33
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:07,450
Operation toilet dive was a search and rescue mission

34
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:11,385
for the action figure I flushed the day before.

35
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:14,668
Never leave a man behind.

36
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,734
Yeah, you're not helping your case here.

37
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,918
I hate to say it, but I think Joey's right.

38
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,430
You're just too young for such a sophisticated toy.

39
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,765
All I want for Christmas now is revenge.

40
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,300
And the helicopter.

41
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:31,235
And the peace on earth stuff, but mostly revenge.

42
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,116
And the helicopter.

43
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:37,238
Dad, come on. Joey's ruining Christmas.

44
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,699
Do something.

45
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,077
I'm a little tied up right now, buddy.
