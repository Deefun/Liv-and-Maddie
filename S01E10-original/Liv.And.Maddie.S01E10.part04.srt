104
00:05:28,239 --> 00:05:30,397
Ho ho ho.

105
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:32,678
No no no.

106
00:05:33,869 --> 00:05:35,969
Dude, what's with the suit?

107
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:41,870
I have a plan to turn Christmas cheer into Christmas ka-ching.

108
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:44,435
Ka-ching just bought you 15 seconds.

109
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:46,776
Impress me.

110
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,178
Okay, so they do that holiday spectacular tree lighting ceremony

111
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:52,578
in the park next to Ridgewood High.

112
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,526
But do you know what they don't have?

113
00:05:54,527 --> 00:05:58,427
Seven more seconds to impress me?

114
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:00,761
A Santa stand.

115
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:05,932
Adorable kids plus sentimental parents equals cold hard cash.

116
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08,845
Whoa. You actually had a good idea.

117
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,526
It's a Christmas miracle.

118
00:06:11,527 --> 00:06:15,921
Well I spent too much on Christmas presents this year and I owe Dad some money.

119
00:06:15,922 --> 00:06:19,162
I need your help. So...

120
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:21,499
You in?

121
00:06:22,536 --> 00:06:25,538
Keep your friends close and your jerky brother closer.

122
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:28,267
If I can't play with the helicopter until I break it,

123
00:06:28,268 --> 00:06:31,779
I'm gonna play with Joey until I break him.

124
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,246
A little quality time with my big bro on Christmas Eve?

125
00:06:36,247 --> 00:06:38,598
- You bet. - [Chuckles]
