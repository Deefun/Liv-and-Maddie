353
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,669
'Twas the night before Christmas!

354
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,021
And all through the park...

355
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:03,677
There are a bunch of people saying "hey, Johnny, why's that tree still dark?"

356
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,913
- Huh? - [Applause]

357
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:09,175
All right, folks. Well, before our big show-stopping solo,

358
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:12,099
Liv Rooney has the honor of lighting that tree.

359
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,399
So let's get her out here, huh? Come on.

360
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,620
[Cheering]

361
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:21,063
[Chuckles, clears throat]

362
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:25,295
Thank you, Johnny. Lighting this tree is a great honor...

363
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:28,782
But it is one that I would like to pass on to the young and...

364
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,988
Very talented Jenny Keene.

365
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,666
This is her moment.

366
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:34,887
[Applause]

367
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,096
Maybe all Jenny needed was that one person to truly care about her

368
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,680
so that she could blossom into the greatest version of herself.

369
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,623
Get off my stage, blondie.

370
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:50,784
[Giggles]

371
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,855
Okay. Maybe not.

372
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:58,013
Merry Christmas, Stevens Point.

373
00:20:00,401 --> 00:20:01,535
[Cheering, exclaims]

374
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,696
Ha! Yes!

375
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,885
Ha ha.

376
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,310
Uh, Dad, is that supposed to be smoking like that?

377
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:26,782
Well, it looks like little Jenny Keene just ruined Christmas.

378
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:31,223
Christmas Tree down. Christmas Tree down!

379
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:35,014
Liv Rooney, you set me up!

380
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,485
She ruined my big moment.

381
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,746
I hate this town, and everyone in it!

382
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,943
And that, ladies and gentlemen...

383
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:51,464
Was little Jenny Keene's impression of Ebenezer Scrooge.

384
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,689
Yay, Jenny. [Chuckles]

385
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,749
Oh, what a talented little actress, am I right?

386
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,890
So that's probably it for the show.

387
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,738
Merry Christmas?

388
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:11,853
Oh. Wow.

389
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,154
She really is a monster.

390
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,268
Yeah, I told you, Mom. She is way worse than I was.

391
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,929
It's Christmas, Sweetie. Sure.

392
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,098
Well, I guess the show's over.

393
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:29,442
- It's a bummer. - Oh, I know, honey. I was...

394
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:33,139
I was really looking forward to your big solo.

395
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,642
Don't give up yet.

396
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:38,612
I think Dad and I may have actually found a way to save Christmas.

397
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,793
Get ready for "Christmas unplugged".

398
00:21:41,794 --> 00:21:43,248
[Squeals]

399
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,577
And Liv gets to sing "let it snow".

400
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:50,618
That is the only song you'll be singing, right?

401
00:21:50,784 --> 00:21:53,424
[Guitar playing]

402
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:57,463
Oh, the weather outside is frightful.

403
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:01,200
But the fire is so delightful.

404
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:04,537
And since we've no place to go...

405
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:08,157
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow.

406
00:22:08,158 --> 00:22:09,948
[Flute playing]

407
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:13,139
Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping.

408
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,080
And I've bought some corn for popping.

409
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:20,193
The lights are turned way down low.

410
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:24,934
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow...

411
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:28,139
Even though it didn't snow, it's kind of the perfect Christmas Eve, huh?

412
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,573
Yeah, except I already broke my helicopter.

413
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,217
Well, at least you have a backup.

414
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,188
Nope, broke that one too.

415
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,506
All the way home I'll be warm.

416
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:42,661
The fire is slowly dying.

417
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:46,621
And my dear, we're still goodbye-ing.

418
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:49,798
But as long as you love me so.

419
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,419
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow.

420
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:59,195
[Cheering]

421
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,805
All right, listen. Good night, everybody.

422
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:05,963
I know it didn't snow, but at least it didn't rain, right?

423
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:09,804
- [Thunder crashes] - [All groan]

424
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,729
Are you kidding me?
