47
00:02:46,889 --> 00:02:48,340
Better in stereo.

48
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:50,422
B... b... better in stereo.

49
00:02:50,423 --> 00:02:52,534
-  I'm up with the sunshine. - Let's go.

50
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:54,609
- I lace up my high tops. - Oh no.

51
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,975
-  Slam dunk. - Ready or not.

52
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,147
Yeah, show me what you got.

53
00:02:59,148 --> 00:03:01,291
-  I'm under the spotlight. - Holler.

54
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:03,581
I dare you, come on and follow.

55
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:07,255
You dance to your own beat. I'll sing the melody.

56
00:03:07,256 --> 00:03:09,796
When you say yea-ah-ah.

57
00:03:09,797 --> 00:03:11,709
I say no-oh-oh.

58
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,409
When you say stop.

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,473
All I want to do is go, go, go.

60
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:19,479
You, you, the other half of me, me.

61
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,654
The half I'll never be.

62
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:25,225
The half that drives me crazy.

63
00:03:25,226 --> 00:03:28,425
You, you, the better half of me, me.

64
00:03:28,426 --> 00:03:30,922
The half I'll always need.

65
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:32,677
But we both know.

66
00:03:32,678 --> 00:03:35,405
We're better in stereo...
