126
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:41,357
This is channel four meteorologist Johnny Nimbus!

127
00:06:41,358 --> 00:06:45,191
Coming at you live from the sight of tomorrow's holiday spectacular.

128
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,937
And I'm here alongside Pete Rooney,

129
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,457
the Chairman of the Stevens Point tree lighting committee.

130
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:53,048
Now, Pete, I see a tree, not a lot of lights.

131
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:56,524
Don't leave us in the dark. [Laughs]

132
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:59,105
Classic Nimbus.

133
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:04,033
But seriously, what have you got planned?

134
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,974
Are we on the air now, like, now now?

135
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:13,835
Now?

136
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,815
Hi.

137
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:19,292
Uh, yeah we're live to over 50,000 viewers.

138
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:21,304
Although I think that number drops every second

139
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:24,296
you stand there like a frozen snowman.

140
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:27,858
Excuse me, Johnny. Hi. I'm Maddie Rooney, co-chair.

141
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,203
And think I could shed some light on that.

142
00:07:31,204 --> 00:07:33,304
[Laughs]

143
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,611
Classic Maddie. [Sighs]

144
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:40,549
So we envision a tree completely lit by candles.

145
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,628
And we call it "Christmas unplugged".

146
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,216
Hmm. "Christmas unplugged".

147
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,468
Well, last year the Griswold family lit their tree with lasers

148
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,256
and then they had a stealth bomber fly over and drop tinsel, but hey...

149
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:55,659
I guess not everybody has to try.

150
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,286
- So... - Uh, wait.

151
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,262
You didn't let me finish.

152
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:04,477
We were going to do the thing that I just said, but then we changed our

153
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,074
minds and came up with something bigger and better and more awesome-er.

154
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:13,411
All right. That's what Stevens Point wants to hear.

155
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:16,314
Come on, give me the deets. What have you got planned?

156
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,955
Merry Christmas.

157
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:22,798
Well, Johnny, I think we're trying to keep

158
00:08:22,799 --> 00:08:25,643
our master plan kind of under wraps right now.

159
00:08:25,644 --> 00:08:29,137
But I can promise you that the Rooney tree is going to be

160
00:08:29,138 --> 00:08:32,462
the biggest and the best that Stevens Point has ever seen.

161
00:08:32,463 --> 00:08:33,775
Bam, what?!

162
00:08:33,776 --> 00:08:35,365
Oh-ho!

163
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,855
All right. You heard it from Maddie Rooney.

164
00:08:37,856 --> 00:08:40,136
Boom, zap!

165
00:08:40,204 --> 00:08:44,093
So don't forget to come on down tomorrow night and see this amazing tree!

166
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:45,777
In the snow!

167
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,835
That's right. Rebel meteorologist Johnny Nimbus is ignoring the mega doppler radar,

168
00:08:50,836 --> 00:08:54,211
and every other station in town to guarantee you!

169
00:08:54,212 --> 00:08:55,749
A white Christmas.

170
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,932
Nimbus out.

171
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,058
- Great job, kid. - Thanks.

172
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:02,159
[Groans]

173
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:03,981
What did I just do?

174
00:09:03,982 --> 00:09:07,050
I just promised that we could top the Griswolds' tinsel flyby.

175
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,916
Why did I just promise that?

176
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:13,237
Next time, just let me do the talking.
