307
00:16:07,614 --> 00:16:12,821
你和肯恩啥时候想出的点子啊  太搞笑了
I don't know when you and Jenny worked out that comedy routine, but it was hysterical.

309
00:16:14,126 --> 00:16:17,038
不  那不是计划之中的  那是那个坏家伙想让我难堪
No, that wasn't planned. She was trying to destroy me.

310
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:22,015
得啦  丽芙  一个可爱的小女孩  才不是想让你难堪呢
[Snorts] Come on, Liv. That sweet little girl was not trying to destroy you.

311
00:16:22,016 --> 00:16:26,649
你们难道没看到橡皮条都被她打断了吗
Did you all not just see the candy cane beat down?

312
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,820
她不择手段就是想让我出丑啊
She was doing absolutely everything she could to make me look bad.

313
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:31,956
丽芙  你行了吧
Give her a break, Liv.

314
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,945
想想你自己昔日的形象吧  
Do you not remember how you were at her age?

315
00:16:33,946 --> 00:16:37,726
绝对不像她一样丧尽天良
I was not a monster like that.

316
00:16:38,107 --> 00:16:42,818
整理衣橱咯  圣诞树还没忙完呢
- I have to go get wardrobe. - Got to work on that tree.

318
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,080
喔喔喔
Ho ho ho.

319
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:52,843
你应该是最后一个了吧
So you are the last kid on Santa's lap.

320
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:54,194
让我想想
What are you gonna do?

321
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:55,858
你要在我身上尿尿  还是喷我一脸口水呢
Pee on me, spit in my face,

322
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:58,683
要往我衣服里洒奇痒粉  还是把我的眼镜扔到百米开外
pour itching powder down my suit, throw my glasses in the bushes?

323
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:02,464
小鬼  这些痛苦我今天都经历过了
I have seen it all today, kid.

324
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:05,991
来吧  你挑一个  早完事早闪人
Just pick one and do it quick.

326
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:13,133
用我的胡子擦鼻涕  忍无可忍  
Blowing your nose in my beard was not an option.

327
00:17:13,134 --> 00:17:15,774
给我走开
Get off of me.

329
00:17:20,336 --> 00:17:22,191
终于来了  帕克
Parker, there you are.

330
00:17:22,192 --> 00:17:25,252
10美元  放到罐子里去  我们赚了多少了
Here's 10 bucks. Add it to the pot. How much did we end up with?

331
00:17:25,253 --> 00:17:30,265
加上这10美元的话  是  是
Including the 10 bucks, that would be... [mouths]

332
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:32,486
还是10美元
10 bucks.

333
00:17:33,231 --> 00:17:37,310
啥  你一个下午收钱收的手都该抽筋了吧  钱呢
What? They've been handing you money all afternoon. Where did it go?

334
00:17:37,311 --> 00:17:41,059
对不起啦  我是说10美元  还有这个
I'm sorry. I meant 10 bucks and this.

336
00:17:49,451 --> 00:17:52,705
咆哮巨龙直升机
One Screaming Dragon helicopter.

337
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:57,709
你败光了我们的血汗钱  而且竟然给自己买了个模型飞机
You used all of our Santa money and bought yourself the helicopter?

338
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,639
可不止一个飞机哦  我还收买给那些小孩  我要他们在你身上尿尿  喷你口水
I also paid kids to pee on you, spit in your face,

339
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:06,540
往你衣服里洒奇痒粉  把你的眼镜扔到百米开外
pour itching powder down your suit, and throw your glasses into the bushes.

340
00:18:06,617 --> 00:18:07,807
为什么  到底是为什么
Why?

341
00:18:07,808 --> 00:18:11,691
因为就在老妈决定给我买模型飞机的时候  你突然跳出来  美梦破碎  你懂的
Because Mom was gonna get that helicopter for me until you wrecked my dream.

342
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,419
这就是报应
Welcome to Christmas revenge.

343
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,960
怎样啊
Ho-ho-how you like me now?

344
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:23,531
我承受这些该死的痛苦  就是为了给你买圣诞礼物
The only reason I did this Santa stand was so I could pay off your Christmas present.

346
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:28,956
我费尽心思让妈妈别给你买
I talked Mom out of getting you that helicopter...

347
00:18:28,957 --> 00:18:32,917
是因为我已经买了呀  蠢蛋
Because I already got it for you.

348
00:18:33,548 --> 00:18:37,014
真对不起  没想到你会这么好
I'm sorry, munch. I had no idea you cared.

349
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,253
我也对不起  这就是圣诞吧
Me either. I guess it's just the Christmas spirit.

350
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:42,414
来吧  
Come on.

351
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:49,911
你抱我纯粹是因为你爱我呢   还是因为你身上尿味十足
Are you hugging me because you love me, or because you're covered in kid pee?

352
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:53,392
嗯  都是
Mm, why can't it be both?
