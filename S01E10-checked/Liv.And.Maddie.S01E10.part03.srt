1
00:03:35,406 --> 00:03:39,648
哦  我真激动
Oh, I am so excited 

2
00:03:39,649 --> 00:03:40,571
你将在第四频道的节日晚会上担任领衔主演  
that you're headlining channel four's holiday spectacular.

3
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:42,894
部分是因为这事儿有利于小镇
Partly because it's great for the town,

4
00:03:42,895 --> 00:03:47,086
但最主要的原因是我已经告诉组委会你会答应的
but mostly because I'd already told the committee you'd say yes.

5
00:03:47,087 --> 00:03:49,111
我的意思是怎么好意思说不呢
I mean, how can I say no?

6
00:03:49,112 --> 00:03:51,303
这里是八年前我的一切开始的地方
This is where it all began eight years ago.

7
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:54,820
我的小宝贝儿第一次站在舞台上
My little baby's first time out on stage 

8
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:56,328
唱出她的心声
singing her little heart out.

9
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,131
我还记得你唱《寒冷的雪人》《白色圣诞节》
I still remember how you wowed the crowd with "Frosty the Snowman".

10
00:04:01,132 --> 00:04:03,199
和《小小鼓手》
And "White Christmas".

11
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,201
时大家无比惊讶的情景
And "Little Drummer Boy".

12
00:04:06,202 --> 00:04:08,721
当你唱完《哦  耶路撒冷的小镇》的时候
By the time you'd finished "O Little Town of Bethlehem,"

13
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:12,271
我简直感觉身临其境
I felt like I'd walked there myself.

14
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:14,362
我都不想唱完它
I never wanted it to end.

15
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:16,978
其实你几乎没唱完
And it almost didn't.

16
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:19,319
丽芙·鲁尼
Liv Rooney?

17
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:21,961
你好  我是珍妮·肯恩
Hi. I'm Jenny Keene.

18
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:25,361
你好  你就是那个要和我在平安夜
Hi. You are the adorable little girl that I get

19
00:04:25,362 --> 00:04:27,384
同台演出的可爱小女孩吧
to share the stage with this Christmas Eve.

20
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:31,960
我看过你的试唱录像  亲  你确实不错
I watched your audition tape, and you have some serious pipes, young lady.

21
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:35,652
有天赋的感觉真爽  是不
It feels so good to be talented, doesn't it?

22
00:04:35,653 --> 00:04:39,581
我长大了就要像你一样
I want to be just like you when I grow up.

23
00:04:39,582 --> 00:04:42,066
那你确实走对路了
Well, you are certainly on the right track.

24
00:04:42,067 --> 00:04:44,034
八年前  我也和你一样
Eight years ago, I was you.

25
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,458
还是那个眼睛里闪着光的小女孩  
I was a starry-eyed little girl, 

26
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,597
为了第一次在电视上露面激动了好久
excited to make her first TV appearance.

27
00:04:49,554 --> 00:04:52,763
节目结束后  我的生活彻底被改变了
And I mean, after this show, my life changed forever.

28
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:55,227
这是真的  没有它  丽芙永远不会在镇上的电视广告里
It's true. Without it, Liv never would have been cast

29
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,011
扮演曼迪 就是那个会唱歌的围巾
in a local commercial as Mandy, the singing muffler.

31
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:02,380
曼迪说您的围巾顶级好
Mandy says your muffler is a-okay.

32
00:05:03,997 --> 00:05:07,082
我们至今还享受打折优惠呢
We still get a discount.

33
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,644
但我当时确实没有引导我的人  所以我想成为你的引导者
But I didn't really have anyone to guide me, so I wanted to be that for you.

34
00:05:10,645 --> 00:05:14,107
你也知道  这一行会有点难  最好能有个导师
You know, this industry can get kind of tough, and it's good to have a mentor.

35
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:18,743
真是难以置信丽芙·鲁尼将成为我的名人导师 
I can't believe Liv Rooney's going to be my celebrity mentor.

36
00:05:18,744 --> 00:05:20,893
哦  别叫  名人导师
Oh, stop. Celebrity mentor?

37
00:05:20,894 --> 00:05:22,778
你不必那样叫我
You don't have to say that...

38
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,493
我的意思是  要是你非要那样叫我
I mean, you definitely can. 

39
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:28,119
我也不反对
I'm not gonna stop you.
