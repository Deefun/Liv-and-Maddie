Coming at you live from the sight of tomorrow's holiday spectacular.

129
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:49,457
史蒂芬 圣诞树彩灯委员会主席 
the Chairman of the Stevens Point tree lighting committee.

130
00:06:49,458 --> 00:06:53,048
现在 皮特 我看到了一棵树 却没看到彩灯啊
Now, Pete, I see a tree, not a lot of lights.

131
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:56,524
别把我们置身于黑暗之中 
Don't leave us in the dark. [Laughs]

132
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:59,105
真经典 云雨 
Classic Nimbus.

133
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:04,033
但说正的 你们有什么计划 
But seriously, what have you got planned?

134
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:11,974

136
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:15,815
嗨 
Hi.

137
00:07:15,925 --> 00:07:19,292
额，是的，我们面向五万观众直播
Uh, yeah we're live to over 50,000 viewers.

138
00:07:19,293 --> 00:07:21,304
尽管我认为那个数字每秒都在减少 
Although I think that number drops every second

139
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:24,296
你站那跟个雪人似的 
you stand there like a frozen snowman.

140
00:07:24,297 --> 00:07:27,858
打扰一下 强尼 嗨 我是麦蒂鲁尼 联合主席 
Excuse me, Johnny. Hi. I'm Maddie Rooney, co-chair.

141
00:07:27,859 --> 00:07:31,203
我认为我可以透漏一点光（一些事情） 
And think I could shed some light on that.

143
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:36,611
真经典 麦蒂 
Classic Maddie. [Sighs]

144
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:40,549
我们打算用蜡烛点亮圣诞树 
So we envision a tree completely lit by candles.

145
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:43,628
我们叫它“不插电圣诞节”
And we call it "Christmas unplugged".

146
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,216
嗯 “不插电圣诞节” 
Hmm. "Christmas unplugged".

147
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,468
嗯，去年格斯沃德一家用激光点亮了圣诞树 
Well, last year the Griswold family lit their tree with lasers

148
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,256
然后他们用一个神秘的轰炸机飞过并放下了最上面的那颗球，不过嘿 
and then they had a stealth bomber fly over and drop tinsel, but hey...

149
00:07:53,257 --> 00:07:55,659
我想不是每个人都能做到 
I guess not everybody has to try.

150
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,286
所以 额 等一下 
- So... - Uh, wait.

151
00:07:58,287 --> 00:08:00,262
你没让我讲完
You didn't let me finish.

152
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:04,477
我们本打算做我刚刚说的事 不过我们改变 
We were going to do the thing that I just said, but then we changed our

153
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,074
主意了 并且想出了更盛大更好更棒的主意
minds and came up with something bigger and better and more awesome-er.

154
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:13,411
好的 那就是史蒂芬 想听到的 
All right. That's what Stevens Point wants to hear.

155
00:08:13,412 --> 00:08:16,314
拜托  给我些提示 你们有什么计划 
Come on, give me the deets. What have you got planned?

156
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,955
圣诞快乐 
Merry Christmas.

156
00:08:16,315 --> 00:08:18,955
圣诞快乐 
Merry Christmas.
