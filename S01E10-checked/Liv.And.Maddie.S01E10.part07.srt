219
00:11:23,838 --> 00:11:25,016
哦 
Oh.

220
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:28,672
那个女孩真是个天使 她坚持要我给你这些饼干 
That girl is such an Angel. She insisted that I give you these cookies.

221
00:11:28,673 --> 00:11:32,333
妈妈 别吃 
[Gasps] Mom! Don't eat those.

222
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:37,607
我知道我们节日要注意一下碳水化合物摄入量 但这算怎么回事 
Now I know we watch our carbs around the holidays, but what was that?

223
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:39,608
珍妮基尼是个怪物 
Jenny Keene is a monster.

224
00:11:39,609 --> 00:11:40,431
耶 
Yeah.

225
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:43,829
前一秒还是“美丽和优雅拥抱” 
One minute it's "beauty sharing a hug with Grace".

226
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,030
下一秒就变成“注意你后面” 
And the next it's "watch your back".

227
00:11:49,497 --> 00:11:51,232
亲爱的，那不可能 
Honey, that can't be true.

228
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:53,784
刚才在路上 她给我唱“十二天后是圣诞节” 
During the ride home, she sang me "the 12 days of Christmas"...

229
00:11:53,785 --> 00:11:56,856
赞美我的鞋子 给我加油钱 
Complimented my shoes, and offered me gas money.

230
00:11:56,857 --> 00:12:01,091
哈 她是个骗子 你的鞋很丑 
Ha! She's a liar. Your shoes are hideous.

231
00:12:01,092 --> 00:12:02,275
亲爱的
Honey...

232
00:12:02,276 --> 00:12:08,176
想象一下那个小女孩要和丽芙麦蒂同在一个聚光灯下是有多么可怕 
Imagine how scared that little girl must be to share a spotlight with Liv Rooney.

233
00:12:09,002 --> 00:12:12,831
是的 我想你是对的 
Yeah. [Chuckles] I guess you're right.

234
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,972
在我的阴影里肯定很冷 
Must be so cold there in my shadow.

235
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:20,178
听着 这就是做导师的意义 
Look, this is what being a mentor is all about.

236
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:22,895
那个小女孩需要你的引导 
That little girl needs your guidance.

237
00:12:22,896 --> 00:12:24,861
我想每个人在紧张的时候有不同的表现 
I guess everybody gets nervous in different ways.

238
00:12:24,862 --> 00:12:26,659
你知道有些人咬指甲 
You know some people chew their fingernails,

239
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,854
其他一些人变得跟 
and other people turn into a Demon spawn.

240
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:31,625
好了 让我们打起精神来 
Well, let's cheer ourselves up.

241
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:36,925
我们可以再看一次你爸爸在新闻上一动不动的镜头
We can watch the clip of your Dad freezing up on the news again.

242
00:12:36,926 --> 00:12:40,766
圣诞快乐- Merry Christmas. - [Both laugh]
