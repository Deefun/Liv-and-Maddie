00:00:22,909 --> 00:00:26,744
亲爱的  看看我的最新发明的装饰作品
Hey, honey. Check out my latest innovation in tree decorating.

2
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:29,161
我在树下安装了旋转个底座  
I built a base that turns the tree 

3
00:00:29,162 --> 00:00:31,780
装饰树的树的时候就更便捷啦
so you can decorate it easier.

4
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:35,561
我命名为 "旋转树" [Lasy-susan的变体]
I call it "The Tree-zy Susan".

5
00:00:36,393 --> 00:00:39,922
是滴  就在木匠店忙活三周而已
Yep. After just three weeks in the wood shop,

6
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:44,922
老爸就花了5分钟刮胡子  其他时间都用来装饰啦
Dad has shaved five minutes off our decorating time.

7
00:00:44,923 --> 00:00:49,423
妈咪  我想好圣诞愿望啦
I finished my Christmas wish list, Mommy.

8
00:00:49,776 --> 00:00:52,606
实现圣诞愿望的技巧在于
The trick to getting what you really want for Christmas

9
00:00:52,607 --> 00:00:54,862
首先索要那种不可能得到的东西
s to first ask for the impossible.

10
00:00:54,863 --> 00:00:59,031
我也时不时地喊两声"妈咪"  讨好一下
I throw in a "Mommy" or two to grease the wheels.

11
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:01,933
我就想要一件东西  妈咪
I only want one thing, Mommy.

12
00:01:01,934 --> 00:01:04,768
地球和平  人类善良
Peace on earth, good will toward men.

13
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,072
抱歉  那好像是两件事
[Sighs] Sorry, I guess that's two things.

14
00:01:09,073 --> 00:01:12,808
把它们包起来然后放到树下是有点难哈
Well, they're a little tough to wrap and put under the tree.

15
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:14,656
你还有啥愿望
What else is on your list?

16
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,896
我没想过还要什么备选项  
Well, I didn't think I'd need a backup, 

17
00:01:18,897 --> 00:01:19,875
但我想
but I guess I could settle for...

18
00:01:19,876 --> 00:01:22,209
龙鸣号遥控直升机也行
The Screaming Dragon remote pilot helicopter

19
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,410
内置1300万像素摄像头
with a built-in 13-megapixel camera.

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,456
有点儿贵啊
Well, they're kind of expensive.

21
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:34,427
但我们能给你买下那架飞机
But I think we can get you that helicopter.

22
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,395
这就是你怎么搞定滴  儿子
That's how you get 'er done, son.

23
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:40,831
拜托  让帕克以为他在耍我们
Oh, please. Letting Parker think he's "working us".

24
00:01:40,832 --> 00:01:42,822
已经成为圣诞惯例
Has become a Christmas tradition.

25
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:46,504
去年他求我们把臭氧层空洞补上
Last year he asked us to fill in the hole in the ozone layer.

26
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,674
他得到一辆自行车
He got a bike.

27
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:51,403
到底啊  一架直升飞机
Seriously? A helicopter?

28
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:53,661
15分钟之内他就弄坏了
He's just gonna break it in the first 15 minutes.

29
00:01:53,662 --> 00:01:55,425
还不如把钱扔进马桶里冲掉
May as well flush your money down the toilet.

30
00:01:55,426 --> 00:01:57,183
哦  等等  你不能
Oh, wait, you can't.

31
00:01:57,184 --> 00:02:01,684
他的遥控潜水艇已经堵住了
His remote control submarine already clogged it.

32
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:03,863
嗯  我刚刚没想到这一点
Mm, I hadn't thought about that.

33
00:02:03,864 --> 00:02:07,450
马桶潜水行动是为了搜索救援
Operation toilet dive was a search and rescue mission

34
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:11,385
前天我冲进马桶里的玩具
for the action figure I flushed the day before.

35
00:02:11,386 --> 00:02:14,668
一个都不能少哦
Never leave a man behind.

36
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,734
这些对你一点帮助都没有
Yeah, you're not helping your case here.

37
00:02:16,735 --> 00:02:18,918
我不想说  但是我觉得乔伊说的对
I hate to say it, but I think Joey's right.

38
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,430
你年纪太小了而这个玩具又太复杂
You're just too young for such a sophisticated toy.

39
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:26,765
现在圣诞节我最想要的就是复仇
All I want for Christmas now is revenge.

40
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,300
还有那架直升机
And the helicopter.

41
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:31,235
还有地球和平之类的吧  但最重要的是复仇
And the peace on earth stuff, but mostly revenge.

42
00:02:31,236 --> 00:02:34,116
还有那架飞机
And the helicopter.

43
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:37,238
老爸  你看看  乔伊把圣诞节给毁了
Dad, come on. Joey's ruining Christmas.

44
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,699
帮帮我
Do something.

45
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:45,077
哥们儿  我现在有点忙
I'm a little tied up right now, buddy.
