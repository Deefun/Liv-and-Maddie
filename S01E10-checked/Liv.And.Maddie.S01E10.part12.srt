353
00:18:54,718 --> 00:18:57,669
圣诞前夜
'Twas the night before Christmas!

354
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,021
公园之中
And all through the park...

355
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:03,677
你们在说啥  嘿  约翰尼  为啥圣诞树还不亮
There are a bunch of people saying "hey, Johnny, why's that tree still dark?"

356
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:05,913
怎么回事哈
- Huh? - [Applause]

357
00:19:05,914 --> 00:19:09,175
好咧  伙计们  演出开始前
All right, folks. Well, before our big show-stopping solo,

358
00:19:09,176 --> 00:19:12,099
丽芙鲁尼将要为我们点亮这棵圣诞树
Liv Rooney has the honor of lighting that tree.

359
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,399
不如我们把她叫出来  来
So let's get her out here, huh? Come on.

362
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:25,295
谢谢你  约翰  能由我来点亮这棵树真是个荣幸
Thank you, Johnny. Lighting this tree is a great honor...

363
00:19:25,296 --> 00:19:28,782
现在我想要把这个荣幸给一个及其年轻的
But it is one that I would like to pass on to the young and...

364
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,988
及其出色的小甜心  珍妮肯恩
Very talented Jenny Keene.

365
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,666
欢迎她
This is her moment.

367
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:41,096
也许珍妮需要一个真正关心她的人
Maybe all Jenny needed was that one person to truly care about her

368
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:45,680
引导她走向至善至美呢
so that she could blossom into the greatest version of herself.

369
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:48,623
给我走开  你这个金发女
Get off my stage, blondie.

371
00:19:51,155 --> 00:19:53,855
好吧  也许是我错了
Okay. Maybe not.

372
00:19:54,353 --> 00:19:58,013
圣诞快乐  斯蒂文伯恩斯的人们
Merry Christmas, Stevens Point.

374
00:20:01,536 --> 00:20:03,696
太好了
Ha! Yes!

375
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,885
哈哈
Ha ha.

376
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:15,310
呃  爸爸  这东西是这么冒烟的吗
Uh, Dad, is that supposed to be smoking like that?

377
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:26,782
呃  好像珍妮肯恩把圣诞节毁得渣都不剩了
Well, it looks like little Jenny Keene just ruined Christmas.

378
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:31,223
圣诞树完蛋了  圣诞树完蛋了
Christmas Tree down. Christmas Tree down!

379
00:20:31,633 --> 00:20:35,014
丽芙鲁尼  你耍我
Liv Rooney, you set me up!

380
00:20:35,015 --> 00:20:37,485
这个女人毁了我的大好时刻
She ruined my big moment.

381
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:41,746
我恨这个镇子  我恨你们所有人
I hate this town, and everyone in it!

382
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,943
女士们先生们
And that, ladies and gentlemen...

383
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:51,464
刚刚其实是珍妮肯恩在模仿埃比尼泽“吝啬鬼”啦  不要介意哈
Was little Jenny Keene's impression of Ebenezer Scrooge.

384
00:20:51,465 --> 00:20:53,689
耶  珍妮
Yay, Jenny. [Chuckles]

385
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:57,749
多么有才华横溢的小演员啊  不是吗
Oh, what a talented little actress, am I right?

386
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,890
我猜今天的表演就是这样了  吧
So that's probably it for the show.

387
00:21:04,098 --> 00:21:06,738
还是该来一句圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas?

388
00:21:10,128 --> 00:21:11,853
哇
Oh. Wow.

389
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:15,154
她还真是个小魔鬼
She really is a monster.

390
00:21:15,741 --> 00:21:19,268
是啊  我早跟你说过了好吗妈妈  她比我小时候要糟糕几百倍呢
Yeah, I told you, Mom. She is way worse than I was.

391
00:21:19,269 --> 00:21:22,929
记住今天可是圣诞节哦亲爱的
It's Christmas, Sweetie. Sure.

392
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:26,098
嗯  结束了  都结束了
Well, I guess the show's over.

393
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:29,442
失败  不能更失败了   哦  亲爱的亲爱的  我知道  妈妈
- It's a bummer. - Oh, I know, honey. I was...

394
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:33,139
妈妈真的真的很期待很期待你的表演的哦
I was really looking forward to your big solo.

395
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,642
好戏在后头呢
Don't give up yet.

396
00:21:34,643 --> 00:21:38,612
我和老爸要拯救这个圣诞节了
I think Dad and I may have actually found a way to save Christmas.

397
00:21:38,613 --> 00:21:41,793
你们就准备好吧  过一个没电圣诞
Get ready for "Christmas unplugged".

399
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:45,577
丽芙就可以唱《下雪吧》
And Liv gets to sing "let it snow".

400
00:21:45,578 --> 00:21:50,618
唯一的一首歌对吧
That is the only song you'll be singing, right?

402
00:21:53,956 --> 00:21:57,463
哦  外面的天气真可怕
Oh, the weather outside is frightful.

403
00:21:57,464 --> 00:22:01,200
但是屋里的炉火好温馨
But the fire is so delightful.

404
00:22:01,201 --> 00:22:04,537
既然我们没有地方可去
And since we've no place to go...

405
00:22:04,538 --> 00:22:08,157
就下雪吧  下雪吧  下雪吧
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow.

407
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:13,139
雪好像没有要停的征兆
Oh, it doesn't show signs of stopping.

408
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,080
正好可以爆爆米花
And I've bought some corn for popping.

409
00:22:17,081 --> 00:22:20,193
把灯光调暗  好好感受这温馨
The lights are turned way down low.

410
00:22:20,194 --> 00:22:24,934
下雪吧  下雪吧  下雪吧
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow...

411
00:22:25,225 --> 00:22:28,139
虽然没下雪  但是貌似是最棒的一个圣诞了哈
Even though it didn't snow, it's kind of the perfect Christmas Eve, huh?

412
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,573
是的  除了我把模型机给搞破掉了
Yeah, except I already broke my helicopter.

413
00:22:31,574 --> 00:22:33,217
你还有个后备啊
Well, at least you have a backup.

414
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:36,188
没啦  那个也寿终正寝了
Nope, broke that one too.

415
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:39,506
回家的一路上  我都会很温暖
All the way home I'll be warm.

416
00:22:39,507 --> 00:22:42,661
火苗漫漫熄灭
The fire is slowly dying.

417
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:46,621
亲爱的们  再见咯
And my dear, we're still goodbye-ing.

418
00:22:46,622 --> 00:22:49,798
只要你们爱我
But as long as you love me so.

419
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,419
就会下雪
Let it snow, let it snow. Let it snow.

421
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:02,805
好咧大伙  再见各位
All right, listen. Good night, everybody.

422
00:23:02,806 --> 00:23:05,963
没下雪  不过还好至少没下雨对吧
I know it didn't snow, but at least it didn't rain, right?

424
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,729
开什么玩笑啊
Are you kidding me?
