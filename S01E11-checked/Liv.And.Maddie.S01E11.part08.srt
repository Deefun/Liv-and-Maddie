聊天发短信请靠边
Pull over to talk or text.
 
306
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:28,946
唔  这块焦糖烧肉真是太好吃了
Mmm! Gotta love a brown sugar glaze.
 
308
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,450
走廊内严禁饮食
No eating in the halls.
 
309
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:34,518
我忍不住啊  教练
I can't help it, coach.
 
310
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,320
这肉真叫入口即化
Just falls off the bone.
 
311
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:40,291
你拿的好像是上等的烤牛排啊
That's some solid-looking barbecue you got there.

谢谢
Thank you.
 
313

哎呀  黑胡椒放多了
Oh! Too much black pepper.
 
315
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:52,036
烧烤真是一门高深的艺术啊
Ah, it was all so confusing.
 
316
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:54,372
我爸爸是个

素食主义者
A vegetarian.

319
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:00,044
我一直缺少一位烧烤方面的导师
I just have no one to guide me.
 
320
00:13:00,046 --> 00:13:02,313
呃  不是我故意炫耀
Well, I don't like to brag,
 
321
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,982
但是去年夏天我确实在
but last summer I did win
 
322
00:13:04,984 --> 00:13:08,853
史蒂文斯波因特烧烤比赛中拔得头筹
the Stevens Point "Thrilla on the Grilla" cook-off.
 
323
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:12,023
太棒了  鲁尼教练果然吃了烧烤这一套
Oh, yeah! Coach Rooney took the barbecue bait.
 
324
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,924
但是为什么他对我的发型只字未提
But seriously, not one word about the haircut?
 
325
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:15,926
这不是白弄了么
What gives?
