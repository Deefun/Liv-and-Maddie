493
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:03,026
让我把这件事情说说清楚
Let me make one thing clear.

494
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,562
你们两个这是最后一次对调身份
This was the last switch-a-Rooney.

495
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,930
你们六岁那年这么折腾过一次
You did it when you were 6.

496
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,332
然后我在你们两个额头上都
And I wrote your names on your forehead

497
00:21:08,334 --> 00:21:11,034
拿记号笔写了你们的名字
in permanent marker.

498
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:13,871
你们别逼我再这么来一次
Don't make me do that again.

499
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:17,741
对哦  发箍之夏
Ah, yes... the summer of headbands.

500
00:21:17,743 --> 00:21:20,611
话说回来  我们当时的发箍造型都不错呢
To be fair, though, we rocked the headband look.

502
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:23,947
哈  哈  有趣
Ha ha fun fun.

503
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,950
玛蒂  你 17 岁之前不允许考驾照
Maddie, no license till you're 17.

504
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,952
看你这个造型怎么拗
Rock that look.

505
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,356
17 岁  真的
17?! Seriously?

506
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:33,557
莫非你想等到 18 岁再说
You want to make it 18?

507
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:35,659
啊  17 岁啊  等不及了
Ah, 17. Looking forward to it.

508
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,795
还有  丽芙
And Liv,

509
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,429
既然你这么喜欢开车
since you like driving so much,

510
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:41,331
在我通知你之前你是我的私人司机
you are now my personal chauffeur until further notice.

511
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,667
- 不要啊  - 没错
- No! - Yes.

512
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:48,472
万事不算小  万里不称遥
There is no errand too small, no trip too far.

513
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,641
或许我只是出门拿个报纸
I might even have you take me down to the end of the driveway

514
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,909
也会要你开车载我
just to get the newspaper.

515
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,811
我不知道你们怎么看
I don't know.

516
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:56,480
没错  孩子们
That's right, girls.

517
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,749
我刚刚投下了一个巨型老妈弹
I just dropped an atomic mom bomb.

518
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:00,017
嘭
Boom!

519
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,825
她这话不当真吧
She can't be serious about that, right?

520
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,626
我们真的到现在还
Do we seriously still get newspapers

521
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,862
有订报纸上门
delivered to our house?

522
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:15,399
不过你在纳威店里表现不错
Hey, whatever you did down at Neville's totally worked.

523
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:18,035
有个叫孤狼粉丝发起了联署
Some fanboy named lone wolf started a petition

524
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,837
想要片方让我出演特里斯坦
to get me the role of Tristan.

525
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,072
你成功的说服了粉丝们
You won over the fanboys.

526
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,507
谢谢了
Thank you.

527
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,044
我能确定孤狼就是乔伊
Pretty sure lone wolf is actually lone Joey.

528
00:22:28,646 --> 00:22:30,547
你应该去谢谢他的
You should go thank him.

529
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:32,015
等等  我记得你不是说乔伊
Wait, I thought you said that Joey

530
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,817
是哪个想要破坏我们的人么
was the one trying to sabotage us.

531
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:37,120
这事说来话长啊
It was a long and complicated day.

532
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,623
了解
Got it.

533
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,960
还有  很抱歉我搞砸了你的驾照考试
Also I'm sorry about wrecking your driver's test.

534
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:46,029
真的砸了  哈
Literally. Ha!

535
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,065
我给你带来了一个纪念品
And I got you something.

536
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,837
你应该把这个去还给胡佛家
You might want to return this to the... hoovers.

537
00:22:55,473 --> 00:22:56,840
谢了
Thanks.

538
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,141
想起来了
That reminds me.

539
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:00,811
我也有个东西要给你
I got you something as well.

540
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,013
亚蒂的狼尾巴
One of Artie's wolf tails. Yeah.

541
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,618
哦  还有  你今年舞会有舞伴了
Oh! Also I got you a date to the prom.

542
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,987
对哦
Yeah.

543
00:23:09,989 --> 00:23:12,422
亚蒂想知道你到时候打算穿什么
Artie would like to know what kind of dress

544
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:15,926
你是打算穿法师装  还是飞马装
you will be wearing... Wizard or Pegasus?
