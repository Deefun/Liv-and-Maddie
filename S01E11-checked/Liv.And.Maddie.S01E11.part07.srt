249
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:58,763
这就是我杀死猛龙的全过程
Web... and that's how I slay the dragon.
 
250
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,867
嘿  亚蒂  你有空么
Hey, Artie, you got a minute?
 
251
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:03,968
你好啊  乔伊
Hey, Joey.
 
252
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,303
你有女朋友啦
You got a girlfriend?
 
253
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,805
好啊
Burn!
 
254
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:12,176
这怎么会好啊  去年秋天你把你妈带到新生舞会上去了
How is that a burn? You took your mom to the freshman dance last fall.
 
255
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,083
那是什么风把你吹回了
So, what brings you crawling back
 
256
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,985
学校的太  太  太
to the Society of Space... Space... space...
 
257
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,720
空  空  空
Were... were... were... Wol... wol... wol...
 
258
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:24,622
狼  狼  狼  人  人  社团
wol... wol... wol... ves... ves?
 
260
00:10:26,893 --> 00:10:29,227
我被投票开除了社团籍
I was voted out of the Society
 
261
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,929
只是因为觉得戴个狼尾巴很蠢
for suggesting that wolf tails were stupid.
 
262
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:33,631
我错了吗
Was I wrong?
 
263
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:35,800
同志们  我哪里错了
People, was I wrong?
 
264
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,203
我想跟你谈谈我姐丽芙的事
I want to talk to you about my sister Liv.
 
265
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:40,872
别  啦啦啦我听不见
No la la la la.
 
266
00:10:40,874 --> 00:10:43,007
我们绝不会说出那个想亵渎特里斯坦的
We do not speak the name of that she-devil
 
267
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:45,676
女魔头的名字
who wants to desecrate Tristan.
 
268
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,044
除非她委托你来请我陪她跳舞
Unless she sent you to ask me to prom,
 
269
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,607
这样的话  跟她说我也许会答应
in which case, let her know I say maybe.
 
270
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:51,382
不见不散了
Be gone with you.
 
272
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:55,653
听好了  亚蒂
Listen, Artie.
 
273
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,155
我们有个公敌啊
We have a common enemy here,
 
274
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,789
我们必须通力合作
and we need to work together
 
275
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,825
来保证特里斯坦的神圣地位
to defend the iconic character
 
276
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,094
不可被撼动
that is Tristan.
 
277
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:06,197
你我原本是强有力的同盟
We were once powerful allies, you and I.
 
278
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,133
磕碰不断的盟友啊
An uneasy alliance.
 
279
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,737
我的狼耳朵竖起来了
My wolf ears are perked.
 
280
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:15,806
丽芙明天会到纳维尔商店
Liv will be down at Neville's tomorrow.
 
281
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:18,442
我要让你给她秀秀《太空狼人》
I need you to show her the real fangs
 
282
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:21,112
脑残粉真正的獠牙
of a true "Space Werewolves" fanboy.
 
283
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,047
脑残粉
Fanboy?
 
284
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:25,850
这可是个贬义词啊  同志
That term is derogatory, sir.
 
285
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,054
我们更喜欢被称作“空想主义爱好者”
We prefer "fantasy enthusiast."
 
286
00:11:30,056 --> 00:11:31,455
所以你要去砸场子
So will you do it?
 
287
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,358
哦  听起来爽极了  乔伊
Oh, sounds great, Joey.
 
288
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,228
我会高兴地跳着舞钻进你的圈套里啊
I'd happily waltz right into your trap.
 
289
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,463
你把我当傻瓜了吗
Do you take me for a fool?!
 
290
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,201
是的  我确实把你当傻瓜了
Yes. Yes, I do.
 
291
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:48,272
而换做特里斯坦的话就是
But as Tristan himself would say...
 
292
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,907
当你的敌人
When an enemy
 
293
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:53,211
伸出了魔爪  舔一口吧
offers his  paw, lick it.
 
294
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:56,447
若你可在明日将他的后腿
If only to tear off his hind leg...
 
295
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,182
碎成万段
Tomorrow.
 
296
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,052
哦
Oh!
 
297
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,220
不去踢馆子就像是
Saying no to that would be like
 
298
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,188
背叛了特里斯坦一样
saying no to Tristan himself.
 
299
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,023
干得漂亮  孤狼
Well played, lone wolf.
 
300
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,025
干得够漂亮
Well played indeed.
 
302
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:11,195
啊
Aah!
 
303
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,299
傻缺
Nerds!
