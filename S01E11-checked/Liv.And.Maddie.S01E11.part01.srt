1
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:10,775
好了  丽芙和玛蒂很快就要考完驾照回家了
Okay, Liv and Maddie will be back from their driving test any second.
 
2
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,444
准备好庆祝仪式了么
Ready to celebrate?
 
3
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:14,112
来看看
Check it.
 
4
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,384
放声高唱
Sing it loud!
（威斯康星州机动车驾驶执照）
 
5
00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,386
哈  怎样
Bam! What?!
（驾照持有人 丽芙·鲁尼 玛蒂·鲁尼）
 
6
00:00:22,455 --> 00:00:24,656
我简直等不及我拿到驾照
Ooh, I can't wait to get my license
 
7
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,658
能随心所欲开车去任何地方的那一刻了
and be able to go wherever I want.
 
8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,460
当然在市域范围内
Within the city limits.
 
9
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:30,061
在爸妈不准我出门之前
Before my curfew.
 
10
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:33,031
开的还是个闻起来像乔伊臭脚的破面包车
In a beat-up minivan that smells like Joey's feet.
 
11
00:00:34,267 --> 00:00:35,433
还是无比自由啊
Still freedom.
 
12
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:36,668
万岁
Whoo-hoo!
 
13
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,769
这叫自由
Freedom?
 
14
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,639
这是失去自由好不好
Try loss of freedom.
 
15
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:42,507
谁会在无比烦躁还想发短信发到大拇指抽筋
Who wants to drive when you can sit shotgun
 
16
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:44,109
的时候专心开车啊
and text until your thumbs fall off?
 
17
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:45,477
肯定不是我
Not me.
 
18
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,546
我真为玛蒂兴奋  拿到了驾照
I'm stoked for Maddie. Having a license...
 
19
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,481
意味着她可以去任何地方干任何事了
that means she can go anywhere and do anything.
 
20
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,550
像她这么负责任的青少年一定会
That a responsible teenager would do
 
21
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,184
先在严父这里得到批准
after getting approval from her father.
 
22
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,354
我怎么会让她不得到您的恩准就胡作非为呢
Not that I've ever asked her not to get approval.
 
23
00:00:56,356 --> 00:00:57,622
为什么我还在滔滔不绝呢
Why am I still talking?
 
25
00:00:58,725 --> 00:00:59,824
为什么你在我房子里呢
Why are you in my house?
 
26
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:01,459
为什么你不去理个发呢
Why haven't you gotten a haircut?
 
27
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,129
我们的问题都不少啊
We've all got questions.
 
28
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,231
她来了
There she is.
 
29
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:07,766
祝贺了  丽芙
Congratulations, Liv.
 
30
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,235
咱们的两个新司机之一
One of our two new drivers.
 
31
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,770
先别急着喝彩
Yes. Hold your rah-rahs.
 
32
00:01:11,772 --> 00:01:14,205
我们中只有一个过了考试
Only one of us passed.
 
33
00:01:14,207 --> 00:01:16,174
真是倒霉催了啊
Total bummer-rang.
 
34
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:17,776
啊  你下次就会拿到驾照了  孩子
Aw, you'll get it next time, kid.
 
35
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:20,679
不  我才是过了考试的那个
No. I'm the one who passed.
 
36
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,481
激动人心吧
License to surprise!
 
37
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:26,851
等等  如果你过了  就说明玛蒂没过考试
Wait, if you passed, that means Maddie failed.
 
38
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:29,554
玛蒂从来没考过不及格
Maddie doesn't fail anything.
 
39
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:30,822
- 哦  - 噢
- Ooh! - Oh!
 
41
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:36,294
快烧了  全都烧了
Burn it! Burn it all!
 
43
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,564
好吧
Well...
 
44
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:41,733
我没及格
I failed.
 
45
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,835
想必我终于知道失败的滋味了
Guess I know what it feels like to be a loser now.
 
46
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:46,638
就是乔伊你特别熟悉的那种滋味
You know what I'm talking about, Joey.
 
47
00:01:47,873 --> 00:01:50,842
哎呀  如果你拿到驾照了
Ouch! I would call that a drive-by...
 
48
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:52,844
也算是狗屎运吧
if you had your license.
 
50
00:01:57,883 --> 00:01:59,250
到底发生了什么
So what happened?
 
51
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,752
我跟你讲发生了什么吧
I will tell you what happened.
 
52
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,587
车管所太歧视人了
The DMV discriminates.
（DMV：Department Of Motor Vehicles，车管所) 

53
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,756
他们只把驾照发给能够
Yeah. They only give their licenses
 
54
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,826
完成左转弯的人
to people who can make left-hand turns.
 
55
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:11,796
如果你想把车往左开  这招确实有用
They do come in handy when you want to go left.
 
56
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,499
为啥你要自找没事地开到
Why would you purposefully turn
 
57
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,368
一堆乱糟糟的车流里而抵达你本需
into oncoming traffic when you can go up one block
 
58
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,869
右拐三次就能到的地方
and make three rights?
 
59
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,806
谁这么急着要驾照啊  对不
Who needs their license anyway, am I right?
 
60
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,843
我啊  我要我的驾照啊
I do! I need my license!
 
61
00:02:24,845 --> 00:02:27,912
别担心  玛蒂  我会开车带你去你想去的地方的
Don't worry, Maddie. I'll drive you anywhere you want to go.
 
62
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,314
我怎么还叽里呱啦说个不停啊
Seriously, why am I still talking?
 
63
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:30,715
我怎么还站在这里啊
Why am I still here?
 
64
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,250
我马上去把头发理了
I'll go get my hair cut.
