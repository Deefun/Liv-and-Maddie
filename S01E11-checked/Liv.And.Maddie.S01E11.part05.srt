157
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,443
噢  嘿  丽芙  你想来点巧克力布丁么
Oh! Hey, Liv, you want some chocolate pudding?
 
158
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,445
我们在冰箱里发现了一大碗
We found a big bowl of it in the fridge.
 
159
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:22,814
呃  二位  这可不是巧克力布丁
Um, boys, that's not chocolate pudding.
 
160
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,049
这是我的从巴黎运来的有机面膜
That's my organic face mask from Paris.
 
161
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,985
哦  吼吼吼
Oh, ho ho ho.
 
162
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:29,754
特制的布丁啊
Fancy pudding.
 
163
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,956
对  这是用猩猩的大便做出来的
Yeah. It's made with orangutan poop.
 
165
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:39,063
这猴子的伙食真是不错啊
Well, whatever that monkey ate was delicious.
 
166
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,835
我吃了块香蕉么
Is that banana?
 
167
00:06:43,837 --> 00:06:45,403
好吧  只要
Okay, just...
 
168
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,805
恶心哟  乔伊
Eww, Joey...
 
170
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,141
听好了
Get this.
 
171
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:52,010
不知道谁在网上散布了小道消息
Somehow word has spread through the blogosphere
 
172
00:06:52,012 --> 00:06:54,512
说我可能要饰演《太空狼人》里的特里斯坦
that I'm up for the role of Tristan in "Space Werewolves."
 
173
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:58,182
我们绝不知道消息是怎么泄露到网上的
Not sure how that info leaked out onto the Internet.
 
174
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,451
我们怎么会把这么要紧的大新闻发到
We would never post that juicy tidbit
 
175
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:03,221
“史蒂文斯波因特《太空狼人》粉丝群”里
on the Stevens Point "Space Werewolves" fan page
 
176
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,556
来惹毛这帮狼人粉呢
in hopes of enraging local Tristanites.
 
178
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:09,761
丽芙到时候会感谢我所做的一切的
Liv will thank me for this later.
 
179
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,462
让我猜猜
Let me guess.
 
180
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,564
你饰演特里斯坦的话  脑残粉们
The fanboys were none too pleased
 
181
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:15,566
肯定会把你批判一番的
about you playing Tristan.
 
182
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:16,968
你也许要看清形势
You probably want to throw in the towel
 
183
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,070
知难而退了吧
and back out.
 
184
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,505
呃  不
Uh, no.
 
185
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:21,973
我跟这帮脑子进水的家伙纠结个什么呢
I mean, why do I care what nerd nation
 
186
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:25,977
因为我们是一股强大的势力
Because we are a powerful force to be reckoned with...
 
187
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,579
我是说  他们才是
I mean, they are!
 
188
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:29,914
随便吧
Whatever.
 
189
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:31,616
这周末我要在纳维尔礼品店店参加
This weekend I have a personal appearance
 
190
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,751
一个见面会  签售《放声歌唱》的光盘
at Neville's Novelty Shoppe to sign "Sing it Loud!" DVDs.
 
191
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,019
你们干嘛不跟我来呢
Why don't you guys come with me?
 
192
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:39,490
丽芙  纳维尔商店是脑残粉的大本营啊
Liv, Neville's is fanboy central.
 
193
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:43,061
如果他们发现你对《太空狼人》的情节一无所知
and then find out that you don't know what you're talking about
 
194
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,562
就会把你生吞活剥的
they will eat you alive.
 
195
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,632
这是个生活在太空的狼人故事
He's a werewolf and he lives in space.
 
196
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,600
我觉得我还需要学习的内容都在这本书里了
I think anything else I need to learn about him will be in here.
 
197
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,869
我大概周六前就能看完了吧
I can probably finish this by Saturday, yeah?
 
198
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,104
丽芙  这是第一卷
Liv, that's volume 1.
 
199
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:55,940
总共有 64 卷呢
There are 64 volumes.
 
200
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:57,141
嗬
Hah!
 
201
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,910
怪不得他们要把书翻拍成电影
No wonder they're making this into a movie.
 
202
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,778
谁有工夫看完这么多书啊
Who would want to read all that?
