129
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,010
- 你好啊  迪吉  - 你好啊  鲁尼
- What's up, Diggie? - What's up, Rooney?
 
130
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,813
你的头发怎么了
'Sup with your hair?
 
131
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:17,782
你不会只听了我爸啰嗦几句
You did not get a haircut
 
132
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:19,317
就把头发理了吧
just because my dad told you to.
 
133
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,520
不  怎么会
No. Not at all.
 
134
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,056
我只是觉得头发太长罢了  你认为他会喜欢我的新发型么
I totally needed a trim. Do you think he'll like it?
 
135
00:05:26,425 --> 00:05:28,927
迪吉  你可不能对他言听计从啊
Diggie, you can't let him push you around like this.
 
136
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,595
我是说  尽管你之前的头发是一团乱麻
I mean, your hair was a hot mess,
 
137
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:32,764
但这不是重点啊
but that's not the point.
 
138
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,566
我根本控制不住  行不  我想让他喜欢我啊
I can't help it, okay? I want him to like me.
 
139
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:35,800
他可是你爸  而我们俩是
He's your dad. And you and me are...
 
140
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,036
管它是什么呢
Whatever we are.
 
141
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:40,672
对啊  管它呢
Totally. Whatever.
 
142
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:44,042
呃  你需要找一个
Um... you just need to find something
 
143
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:45,910
你和我爸都喜欢的爱好  以此来拉近关系
that you and my dad both like and bond over that.
 
144
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,512
噢  对  太好了  让我看看
Oh, yeah, okay, great. Let's see.
 
145
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,081
他喜欢对我大吼大叫
He likes growling at me.
 
146
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,916
你知道他还喜欢什么吗
You know what else he likes...
 
147
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,117
烧烤
barbecuing.
 
148
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,920
烤肉架确实比大嗓门好多了
Grilling sure beats growling.
 
149
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,857
而且  如果他开始喜欢我了
And, if he starts to like me,
 
150
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,358
我就可以帮你准备驾照考试了
I could help you prep for your driver's test.
 
151
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,993
哎呀呀
Aww.
 
152
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:04,495
真贴心啊
That's so sweet.
 
153
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,930
老爸你好啊
Hey, Dad.
 
155
00:06:09,068 --> 00:06:10,902
我跟你开玩笑呢  亲  哈哈
Dude, I'm kidding. Ha ha.
 
156
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,437
但他可不会开玩笑
But he won't be.
