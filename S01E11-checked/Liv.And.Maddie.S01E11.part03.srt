89
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,777
各位 我有个大好消息要宣布一下
Guys! I have something really exciting to say.
 
90
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:37,248
你能不能先闭嘴两个小时
How about you pause your piehole for two hours?
 
91
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:40,785
我们待会再聊
We'll get to you later.
 
92
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,288
我们都洗耳恭听了  丽芙
We're all listening, Liv.
 
93
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,456
很好
Okay.
 
94
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,624
今年夏天威斯康星州
There is a major film
 
95
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,493
有一部大电影要进行拍摄
shooting in Wisconsin this summer,
 
96
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:49,728
我被提名参演一个主要角色
and I'm up for a big part.
 
97
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,829
真刺激  电影讲什么的
How exciting! What's it about?
 
98
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,966
大概是关于一群狼崽子在太空里的吧
It's based on some book about wolves in space.
 
99
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,603
《太空狼人》
"Space Werewolves!"
 
100
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:02,807
这是我最喜欢的漫画小说了
That is my favorite graphic novel.
 
101
00:04:02,809 --> 00:04:04,042
不会吧
No way!
 
102
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:05,844
他们想让我饰演特里斯坦
They want me to play Tristan.
 
103
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:08,480
莫非是特里斯坦·莱肯
As in Tristan Lycanth?
 
104
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,481
对
Yeah.
 
105
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,950
那个英雄
The hero?
 
106
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:13,918
哈哈  特里斯坦是个男孩
Ha ha, but Tristan's a boy.
 
107
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,854
准确地说是半狼人半男孩
Technically half-boy, half-werewolf.
 
108
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:18,923
但他绝对不会是个女孩子
But he is definitely not a girl.
 
109
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,926
对  暂时还不是
Right. Not yet.
 
110
00:04:22,128 --> 00:04:24,362
但是制片人看了我在《放声歌唱》里的表现
But the people making the movie saw my episode of Sing it Loud!
 
111
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,766
就是我在国际空间站里唱女高音
right where I dreamt that I was on an international space station
 
112
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,367
打碎了本要撞击地球的小行星
and I saved the earth by singing the high note
 
113
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,469
拯救了芸芸众生的那一集
that shattered the asteroid before it hit earth. Aah!
 
116
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37,308
我太喜欢那集了
I love that episode.
 
117
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,410
真的吗 我觉得这里面逻辑错误不少啊
Really? 'Cause I had some logic problems with it.
 
118
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,678
但是你太出彩了 亲爱的
But you sparkled, honey.
 
119
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,816
他们实在是太喜欢我了 甚至要考虑把原著的男性角色
They liked it so much that they're considering changing the role of Tristan
 
120
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,385
为了我而改成女的
into a girl just for me.
 
121
00:04:48,687 --> 00:04:50,722
我为了丽芙着想  必须要阻止她
I had to stop Liv for her own good.
 
122
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,624
脑残粉太痴狂了
Fanboys are crazy.
 
123
00:04:52,626 --> 00:04:54,325
我明白这点  因为我也是其中之一
I should know. I'm one of them.
 
125
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:57,729
那可是特里斯坦·莱肯啊
We're talking about Tristan Lycanth.
 
126
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:00,865
自由世界的捍卫者啊
Keeper of the claw of freedom.
 
127
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:04,736
这俩根本就摆不到一起去
Does this match this?
