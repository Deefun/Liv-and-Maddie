203
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,917
呃
Ugh!
 
204
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,685
呃
Ugh!
 
205
00:08:08,687 --> 00:08:11,022
一本交规
323 pages
 
206
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,590
323 页
of "Rules of the Road,"
 
207
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:13,825
而编者只字未提
and not once did they admit
 
208
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,593
左转进一堆车流里
that turning left into oncoming traffic
 
209
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,595
是很蠢的
is insane.
 
210
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:20,666
420 页的狼人和飞船的故事
420 pages of werewolves and spaceships,
 
211
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,934
而其中唯一我认真看的就是
and the only thing I'm really looking is that
 
212
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,761
我穿上特里斯坦的宇航服帅呆了
I think I could totally rock Tristan's space suit.
 
213
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,871
没错啊
Yeah...
 
214
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,840
等你看到穆尔斯战役那一段
just wait till they get to the Battle of Mirth.
 
216
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,242
也就是他遇见凯特拉那段
That's when he meets Kytra,
 
217
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,910
再后面的历险故事就引人入胜了
and that's when the adventure really kicks off.
 
219
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,216
你这科幻迷藏得够深啊
You undercover Sci-Fi geek.
 
220
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:41,552
你完全就读过这本书
You've totally read this book.
 
221
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:42,987
对  我其实全套都看了
Yeah, I've actually read them all.
 
222
00:08:42,989 --> 00:08:44,789
我很喜欢这书  而且我必须承认
I love them. And I have to admit...
 
223
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,792
我其实看你去饰演特里斯坦是持观望态度的
I am a little on the fence about you playing Tristan myself.
 
224
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,595
好吧  其一  你怎敢这么说
Okay... one, how dare you.
 
225
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,232
其二  帮帮我吧
And two, help me.
 
226
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,734
得了吧  丽芙  你急个什么呢
Okay, Liv, why are you wigging out?
 
227
00:08:56,736 --> 00:08:58,636
因为我真的很想要这个角色啊
Because I really want this role.
 
228
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,937
我知道我已经是个明星了
I mean, I know that I've been playing it cool,
 
229
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:01,939
但是参演的这部电影分量最大
but this is way bigger than my show
 
230
00:09:01,941 --> 00:09:05,176
还能完全把我的演艺事业提升到一片崭新的空间
and it could send me into a completely new acting stratosphere.
 
231
00:09:05,178 --> 00:09:08,279
但我却不知道怎么给脑残粉留下深刻的印象
I just have no idea how to impress these fanboys.
 
232
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,781
呃  好吧  我的确很想帮你
Okay, well, I would love to help you
 
233
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,682
但是  丽芙  我的驾照考试和你的
but, Liv, my driver's test is on the same day
 
234
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:12,984
签售会在同一天啊
as your autograph signing.
 
235
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:14,185
而我还不知道怎么
And I still have no idea
 
236
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,587
完成这个愚蠢的左转弯
how to make a stupid left-hand turn.
 
237
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:19,624
我有个疯狂的好主意啦
I have a twin-sane idea!
 
238
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:24,028
这周六  我就是你而你就是我
This Saturday, I'll be you and you be me.
 
239
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,696
- 等下  你指的是  - 姐妹身份对调
- Wait, you mean like... - A switch-a-Rooney.
 
241
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:30,868
我去摆平这帮脑残粉
I'll face your fanboys.
 
242
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,737
而你帮我把驾照拿到手
And I will take your driver's test.
 
243
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,639
太完美了
Perfect!
 
244
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:36,274
为什么你的床黏糊糊的
Why is this bed so squishy?
 
246
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:45,950
因为我坐在一摊比萨饼上啊
Because I am sitting on a pizza.
 
247
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:49,053
体谅一下半夜饿肚子的女孩吧
A girl gets hungry at 3:00 A.M.
