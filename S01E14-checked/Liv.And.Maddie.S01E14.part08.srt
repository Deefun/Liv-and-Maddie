别这么偷偷靠近我
Do not sneak up on me like that.
 
218
00:09:12,495 --> 00:09:14,463
你在维罗的储物柜前干什么呢
What are you doing at Willow's locker?
 
219

那是一张留言条吗
Is that a note?
 
221
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,437
对  你千万别和任何人说
Yeah, actually, don't tell anyone,
 
222
00:09:22,472 --> 00:09:23,672
但是我在帮我们俩一个忙

这是一封匿名的情书
It's a secret admirer note
 
224
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,309
来帮维罗移情别恋
to get Willow to stop obsessing about you.
 
225
00:09:27,343 --> 00:09:29,277
我希望你写好点
I hope you wrote a good one.

Willow's got a bad case of the Joeys,
 
227
00:09:31,314 --> 00:09:32,714
我还不确定有药能治好
and I'm not sure there's a cure.
 
228
00:09:35,651 --> 00:09:38,620
唔  我脖子后边的汗毛立起来了
Hmm, the hairs on the back of my neck just stood up.
 
229
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:40,755
维罗要来了 快跑
Willow's coming. Run.

有人喜欢我
Secret admirer?
 
234
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:06,715

Oh-ho. No way.
 
235
00:10:06,749 --> 00:10:08,550
看起来她相信了
It looks like she's buying it.
 
237
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:12,487
