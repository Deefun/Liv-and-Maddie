190
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,318
哦  太好了  你在这儿  我必须要找人聊聊
Oh, good, you're here. I really need to talk.
 
191
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,320
噢  我洗耳恭听
Oh, I'm all ears.
 
193
00:08:00,623 --> 00:08:03,325
好的  维罗在低谷期  她投不了球
Okay, Willow's in a slump and she can't pitch,
 
194
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:05,460
这会让她进不了学校垒球队的
and that's gonna keep her from making varsity softball.
 
195
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:07,596
体育运动  我不在行
Sports.
 
197
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:13,735
但是她投不了球的原因
But the reason she can't pitch
 
198
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,670
是因为她无法全神贯注于任何事
is because she can't concentrate on anything
 
199
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:17,539
一心只有她对乔伊的疯狂迷恋
other than her massive crush on Joey.
 
200
00:08:17,573 --> 00:08:20,275
哦  感情  这东西我在行
Ooh, feelings. Yay.
 
201
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:23,278
维罗是个好苗子
Willow's just so awesome,
 
202
00:08:23,312 --> 00:08:25,614
我希望她能意识到大千世界除了乔伊以外
and I wish she would realize that there's so much more out there
 
203
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:28,350
还有无数的新鲜玩意等着被发掘
in the world for her other than just Joey.
 
204
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:32,320
那就让她看看大千世界的新鲜玩意啊
Okay, so make her see that there's more out there.
 
205
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,457
在她的储物柜里留一张匿名者的情书
Put a love note from a secret admirer
 
206
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:38,326
她就会把乔伊忘得一干二净的
in her locker, and she'll forget all about Joey.
 
207
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:40,695
丽芙  这个主意棒极了
Liv, that's actually a really good idea.
 
208
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:43,565
事实上  我还记得四年级时
Actually, I remember in fourth grade
 
209
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,700
当我沉湎于马基·斯蒂文而不能自拔时
when I was so obsessed with marky Stevens
 
210
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,303
我简直都玩不好儿童足球了
that I literally couldn't even play kickball.
 
211
00:08:48,337 --> 00:08:51,306
之后我收到了一封匿名情书  写信的原来是
And then I got a secret admirer note from...
 
212
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,707
你
You.
 
213
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:57,312
之后谁在学校儿童足球赛
And who went on to win top prize
 
214
00:08:57,346 --> 00:08:58,647
独占鳌头了啊
in the school kickball-y thing?
 
215
00:08:58,681 --> 00:08:59,714
别说了  不用谢
Uh-huh, you're welcome.
