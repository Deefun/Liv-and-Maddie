00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,200
来把我的狼耳朵和獠牙取下来
to get my ears and my fangs off.
 
388

它们固若金汤啊  我试着取消采访
They wouldn't budge. I tried cancelling
 
389
00:17:08,337 --> 00:17:10,538
但是强尼·尼比斯还是准时出现了
and Johnny nimbus showed up anyway.
 
390
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:13,207
所以我做了任何好演员都会做的事
So I did what any great actress would do.
 
391
00:17:13,242 --> 00:17:15,209
我把我歪瓜裂枣的地方都用戏服与道具藏好了
I hid my flaws with wardrobe and props.
 
392

397
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,530
我们的节目是没有孩子看的
No kids are watching this program.
 
398
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:40,668

And here's a secret I learned from Nana nimbus.
 
405
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:58,252
不要用水来煎  改用清鸡汤吧
Don't use water. Use chicken broth instead.
 
406
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,287
丽芙·鲁尼  你能帮我开一下么
Liv Rooney, could you open that for me.

很不错
There you go.
 
414
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:17,205
就只要随意的把鸡汤倒进去
Just liberally putting it in there.
 
415
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:18,406
做好了就会非常美味的
They're gonna taste great.

来坐到桌前侃侃大山吧
Let's sit down to chew the fat.
 
418
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,244
照字面意思讲
And I mean that literally.
 
419
00:18:23,278 --> 00:18:24,645
这些烤香肠九成都是脂肪
These brats are 90% fat.

00:18:37,393 --> 00:18:39,227
噢  丽芙  我来拉你起来

425
00:18:39,261 --> 00:18:40,428
我的老天爷啊
Here... oh!
 
426
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,264
是我被咖啡灌糊涂了
Either I've had too much coffee,
 
427
00:18:43,298 --> 00:18:44,499
还是狼人是真的
or werewolves are real!
 
428
00:18:46,535 --> 00:18:50,405
呃
Um...
 
429
