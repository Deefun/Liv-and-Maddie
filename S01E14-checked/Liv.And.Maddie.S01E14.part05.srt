129
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:18,504
好了  维罗  准备好了么
Okay, Willow, ready?
 
130
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:20,272
集中注意力  向我投球  就朝着这儿
Focus. Fire one at me. Right here.
 
131
00:05:23,309 --> 00:05:25,177
太棒了
Perfect...
 
132
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:27,446
如果我们是在玩砸花盆的话
If we were playing "smash that pot."
 
133
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:32,284
维罗  你状态几天都不好了
Willow, you've been in a slump for days.
 
134
00:05:32,318 --> 00:05:33,585
我只是不能全神贯注罢了
I just can't concentrate.
 
135
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,288
那好  垒球选拔赛就在这周末
Okay, well, softball tryouts are this weekend,
 
136
00:05:36,322 --> 00:05:38,190
如果我们要成为校队里的首批二年级生的话
and if we want to be the first sophomores to make varsity,
 
137
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:39,291
你就必须得认真投入比赛
then you gotta get your head in the game.
 
138
00:05:39,325 --> 00:05:41,427
你到底遇上什么问题了
What is your problem?
 
139
00:05:41,461 --> 00:05:43,362
你知道吗  我一说起这事
You know what? I just don't feel comfortable
 
140
00:05:43,396 --> 00:05:44,530
就浑身不舒服
talking about it.
 
141
00:05:44,564 --> 00:05:46,231
那行  我们必须要趁着选拔赛前
Okay, well, we have to get to the bottom
 
142
00:05:46,266 --> 00:05:48,200
把你所有的问题都消灭干净
of whatever this is before tryouts.
 
143
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:49,334
如果你不愿意和我聊天的话
And if you're not willing to talk to me,
 
144
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:50,536
也许我们就需要一些专业的帮助了
then maybe we need some professional help.
 
145
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,205
谁刚刚说了专业的帮助来着
Did someone say "professional help"?
 
147
00:05:55,308 --> 00:05:57,342
这一天终于到来了
It is finally happening.
