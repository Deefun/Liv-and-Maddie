38
00:01:36,316 --> 00:01:37,349
终于来了  终于来了
It's here! It's here.
 
39
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:38,584
我的未来终于来到了
My future is here.
 
40
00:01:38,618 --> 00:01:40,319
我的未来就在这儿
My future is here!
 
41
00:01:40,353 --> 00:01:42,254
夹在两片面包的中间
Between two slices of bread.
 
42
00:01:43,623 --> 00:01:45,357
你的未来还早着呢
Your future can wait.
 
43
00:01:45,392 --> 00:01:47,393
天啊
Look.
 
44
00:01:49,462 --> 00:01:51,263
这不就是《太空狼人》里的道具服么
That's the costume from "space werewolves."
 
45
00:01:52,432 --> 00:01:54,500
《太空狼人》可是一部一鸣惊人的动作电影
"Space werewolves" is a big action blockbuster
 
46
00:01:54,534 --> 00:01:56,635
就像是下一部《暮光之城》一样
that's gonna be kind of like the next "twilight,"
 
47
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,572
除了主角是太空中的狼人而非地球上的吸血鬼
except it's werewolves in space instead of vampires on earth.
 
48
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:01,173
这个的可信度要高多了
It's way more believable.
 
49
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,543
所以  你得到了领衔主演的位置
So, you got the lead in the movie.
 
50
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:07,313
还没有  其实导演组认为一个姑娘看起来不够坚强
No. They actually don't think a girl will look tough enough.
 
51
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:09,315
所以你偷走了戏服
So you stole the suit
 
52
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:10,583
这样他们就拍不成电影了
so they can't make the movie.
 
53
00:02:10,617 --> 00:02:12,518
你就这么心术不正啊
You are diabolical.
 
54
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:16,355
事实上  我跟他们说了要把狼人戏服寄给我
Actually, I talked them into sending me the werewolf suit
 
55
00:02:16,389 --> 00:02:18,257
这样我就能拍照片来证明他们想错了
so I can take pictures in it to prove them wrong.
 
56
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:21,193
这样也成啊
That could work too.
 
57
00:02:21,228 --> 00:02:22,528
我更喜欢心术不正的你
I like you better diabolical.
 
59
00:02:24,231 --> 00:02:25,531
丽芙  大好消息
Liv, great news.
 
60
00:02:25,565 --> 00:02:26,632
电视台第四频道刚打来电话
Channel four just called.
 
61
00:02:26,666 --> 00:02:29,201

They're coming to the house this Friday
 
62
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:30,269

63
00:02:30,303 --> 00:02:32,504
来做他们的早间烹饪节目
for their morning news cooking segment.
 
64
00:02:32,539 --> 00:02:35,407
我要上《尼比斯私房菜》了
I'm doing "Nibbling with Nimbus"?
 
65
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:37,376
对的 简直不敢相信
Yes. Can you believe it?
 
66
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,644
我爱死那个节目了
I love that segment.
 
67
00:02:38,678 --> 00:02:43,582
上周  尼比斯和范·迪塞尔一起油炸了一只火鸡
Last week, nimbus deep fried a Turkey with Vin Diesel.
（范·迪塞尔：美国电影演员，制片人）
 
68
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:45,551
等等  妈妈  你刚刚说的是周五么
Wait, mom, did you say Friday?
 
69
00:02:46,686 --> 00:02:49,555
又是《太空狼人》摄影
So a "space werewolves" movie photo shoot
 
70
00:02:49,589 --> 00:02:51,390
又是一个直播电视访谈
and a live TV interview.
 
72
00:02:52,592 --> 00:02:55,261
好了  这一周赶通告压力大咯
Okay, this is shaping up to be an oddly stressful week.
 
73
00:02:55,295 --> 00:02:58,297
但是  幸亏你有一个超级酷的妈妈
Well, luckily you have a super-cool mom
 
74
00:02:58,331 --> 00:03:01,367
还是一个可以帮你应付一切压力的治疗师
who's also a therapist. And she can help you manage your stress.
 
75
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,269
太好了  因为我马上需要你的帮助
Good. Because I am going to need your help
 
76
00:03:03,303 --> 00:03:05,204
帮我挑出最上镜的那套衣服
picking out a TV-rrific outfit.
 
77
00:03:05,238 --> 00:03:06,372
你需要我的时尚建议
You want my fashion advice.
 
78
00:03:06,406 --> 00:03:08,173
天啊  这一天终于到来了
Oh, it's finally happening.
 
79
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,341
那好
Okay.
 
80
00:03:09,376 --> 00:03:11,343
一件农妇衫
How about a peasant blouse
 
81
00:03:11,378 --> 00:03:13,646
外加一条紧身裤怎么样
with some sensible trousers?
 
82
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,414
果然 找你要建议大错特错了
Yeah, this was a mistake.
