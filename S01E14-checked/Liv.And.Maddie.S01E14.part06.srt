148
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:01,580
谢谢你们来到我的办公室见我
Thank you for seeing me in my office.
 
149
00:06:01,614 --> 00:06:05,350
谢谢你开车带我们来
Thank you for the ride.
 
150
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:08,353
那是  我觉得在这了谈心会更加舒适
Well, I thought we would be more comfortable here.
 
151
00:06:08,388 --> 00:06:10,456
而你们看见我所有的学历和证书时
And I thought you'd be more receptive to my words
 
152
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,191
也能更好的听进我的话
if you could see all my degrees.
 
153
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:16,428
总之  维罗不会投球了
So, Willow can't pitch.
 
154
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,363
对极了  治好她
Exactly. Fix her.
 
155
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:23,502
那么你就告诉我这幅罗夏测试图
So you tell me what is the first thing
（罗夏测试：通过墨迹图来反映被测者心理状况）
 
156
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:26,205
在你脑中最像什么
that pops into your head.
（墨迹图为左右对称，剧中测试方法不规范）
 
157
00:06:26,239 --> 00:06:27,206
乔伊
Joey.
 
158
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:30,542
乔伊
Joey.
 
159
00:06:34,414 --> 00:06:36,548
乔伊在骑一匹长得像乔伊的马
Joey on a horse that looks like Joey.
 
160
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,651
好了
Okay.
 
161
00:06:39,686 --> 00:06:41,487
我看来要大胆推测
I'm gonna go out on a limb here
 
162
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:43,655
认定这其中肯定和乔伊
and say that this has something
 
163
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:44,656
有密不可分的联系
to do with Joey.
 
164
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,227
哇  你真在行
Wow, you're good.
 
165
00:06:49,329 --> 00:06:51,630
乔伊
Joey?
 
166
00:06:51,664 --> 00:06:52,664
这一切都是关于乔伊的
This whole thing is about Joey?
 
167
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:54,399
玛蒂  在这里我们要心平气和
Maddie, this is a safe place.
 
168
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:55,567
不要随意给别人下定论
We do not judge,
 
169
00:06:55,602 --> 00:06:57,202
哪怕这是你脑中
even if it is the first place
 
170
00:06:57,237 --> 00:06:58,370
第一个想去的地方
your brain wants to go.
 
171
00:06:59,572 --> 00:07:02,441
那么你和乔伊到底是什么关系
Okay, so what is going on with you and Joey?
 
172
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:04,543
没任何关系  这就是症结了
Nothing. That's the problem.
 
173
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,246
正是春意盎然之时
It's springtime.
 
174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,149
爱意弥漫在空中  鸟儿在枝头谈情说爱
Love is in the air, birds are chirping,
 
175
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:11,483
可我魂牵梦绕的一切就是
but all I can think about is
 
176
00:07:11,518 --> 00:07:15,387
为何我的小乔伊不跟我谈情说爱啊
why doesn't my sweet little Joey bird chirp at me?
 
177
00:07:15,421 --> 00:07:18,557
那到底乔伊和你的投球有什么关系
Okay, what... what does Joey have to do with your pitching?
 
178
00:07:18,591 --> 00:07:21,193
我集中不了注意力
I can't concentrate.
 
179
00:07:21,227 --> 00:07:23,395
当我投球时 我直视着你
When I pitch, I look directly at you.
 
180
00:07:23,429 --> 00:07:26,165
- 对的  - 但我每次看你
- Right. - But every time I look at you,
 
181
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,533
脑中就浮现出乔伊
all I see is Joey.
 
182
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:31,403
我长得像乔伊  不可能
I look like Joey?! No, okay.
 
183
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:33,305
我们都戴眼镜
We both wear glasses,
 
184
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:36,341
可这就是唯一的相同点了  好不
but that is where the similarity ends, right?
 
185
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:37,442
对不
Right?!
 
186
00:07:38,545 --> 00:07:40,379
所以你投球水平这么烂
So the reason you stink at pitching
 
187
00:07:40,413 --> 00:07:41,413
责任在我头上
is because of me?
 
188
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:44,183
对  你们俩长得简直像极了
Yeah. You guys look exactly like each other.
 
189
00:07:44,217 --> 00:07:45,317
只不过他才能打动我
Except he makes it work.
