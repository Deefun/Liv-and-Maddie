83
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:21,487
绿带的学员们  掌握龙之真气
Green belts, the path of the dragon
 
84
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:23,188
绝非易事
is not easy.
 
85
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:27,593
嘿呀
Hyah!
 
86
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:29,528
别给吓趴下了
Do not be scared.
 
87
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:31,497
这苍蝇还活着  勉强算吧
The fly lives, barely.

89
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,266
我这么做的目的是杀鸡儆猴
But only so he can warn his friends
 
90
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:37,202
三心二意是绝对不可饶恕的
that distractions will not be tolerated.
 
91
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:41,507
天啊  蕾·道伊老师可不是闹着玩的
Wow, Sensei Rae Dawn is no joke.
 
92
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:44,209
我听说如果你直视她的眼睛
I heard if you look directly in her eyes,
 
93
00:03:44,244 --> 00:03:47,346
她就能偷走你的灵魂
she can steal your soul.
 
94
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,348
小龙帕克
Dragon Parker,
 
95
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:50,683
你准备好通过释放出
are you ready to advance from green belt
 
96
00:03:50,717 --> 00:03:52,217
你内在的龙之真气
to blue belt
 
97
00:03:52,252 --> 00:03:53,485
来表演飞龙跳跃后空踢
by unleashing your inner dragon
 
98
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,488
把你的绿带升级为蓝带了吗
and performing the leaping dragon back-kick?
 
99
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:58,490
准备好了 老师
Ready, Sensei.
 
100
00:04:00,226 --> 00:04:02,227
嘿呀
Hyah!
 
102
00:04:04,197 --> 00:04:06,565
很令人钦佩 年轻的小龙
Impressive, young dragon.
 
103
00:04:08,234 --> 00:04:09,301
这是你的蓝腰带
Your belt.
 
104
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:12,438
提醒一下你们的父母 新腰带价值 9.95 美元
Remind your parents it's 9.95 for the new belt
 
105
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,273
你踢烂的靶子价值 1.2 美元
and 1.20 for the target you broke.
 
106
00:04:17,644 --> 00:04:19,345
小龙埃文
Dragon Evan,
 
107
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:21,447
- 你准备好  - 你先等等再说
- are you ready... - Let me stop you right there.
 
108
00:04:23,216 --> 00:04:25,284
我妈说我今天还不能释放龙之真气
My mom says I can't unleash my dragon today.
 
109
00:04:25,318 --> 00:04:26,485
什么
Excuse me?
 
110
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:29,188
她觉得我不能参加一个
She thinks I shouldn't participate in an activity
 
111
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:31,490
以成败评判小孩子的活动
where kids are judged in terms of winning or failing.
 
112
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,660
尤其是我失败已经板上钉钉了
Especially when I'm going to fail.
 
113
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,398
总之我今天能通过
Anyway I can get a blue belt
 
114
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:41,200
敞开心扉来促膝长谈
by being open about my feelings
 
115
00:04:41,234 --> 00:04:42,634
而拿到蓝带么
and talking out issues?
 
116
00:04:44,337 --> 00:04:48,240
看起来你内在的小龙更像是冒牌的蜥蜴啊
Seems your inner dragon is more of a salamander.
 
117
00:04:48,274 --> 00:04:49,441
想拿腰带  没门
No belt for you.
 
118
00:04:49,476 --> 00:04:52,344
你有一周时间来努力拿到蓝腰带
You have one week to earn your blue belt
 
119
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,381
要么就忍辱负重的看着班里其他人
or endure the shame of watching the rest of the class
 
120
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,549
挪到周二 2 点半的那节课
move on to the 2:30 Tuesday slot
 
121
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,418
就除了你
without you.
 
122
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:03,455
我绝对不能就这么让老师
There was no way I was gonna let the sensei
 
123
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,157
拆开我们
break up the team of
 
124
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:06,492
极品武术双人组
super-awesome martial arts dude
 
125
00:05:06,526 --> 00:05:08,327
和他挚爱的老哥们
and his beloved sidekick,
 
126
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:12,331
雀斑  和嬉皮笑脸的冒牌蜥蜴
freckles, the smiling salamander.
 
127
00:05:12,365 --> 00:05:13,432
耶
Yeah.
 
128
00:05:13,466 --> 00:05:14,600
埃文也许要换一个新绰号了
Evan might need a new nickname.
