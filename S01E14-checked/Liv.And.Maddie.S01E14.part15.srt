我不想让我最好的朋友

482
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,452
你不会真的不打垒球了吧  对吗
You're not really quitting softball, are you?
 
483
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,288
不会的  你说得对
No, you're right.
 
484
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,390
我们要冲校队名额了

我不应该对一个傻小子牵挂这么久的

493
00:21:44,646 --> 00:21:46,547
咬定了你暗恋她
Willow think that you were her secret admirer.
 
494
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,282
