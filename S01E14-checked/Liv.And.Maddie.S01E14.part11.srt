296
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,354
嘿  小玛
Hey, mads.
 
297
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:01,356
今天天气真不错啊
What a beautiful day.
 
298
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,291
我看见了心形的云朵
I see heart shapes in the clouds,
 
299
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,594
和闻起来像茉莉和热狗的空气
and the air smells like Jasmine and hot dogs.
 
300
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,433
我得到了一张匿名情书
I got a note from a secret admirer.
 
301
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,401
你真得到了
You did?
 
303
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:17,639
哇  刚才那真不是我们的风格
Wow, that's totally unlike us.
 
304
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,708
对  以后再也别这么做了
Yeah, let's please never do that again.
 
305
00:13:22,445 --> 00:13:24,579
但是我不能不说我很吃惊
But I can't really say I'm surprised.
 
306
00:13:24,613 --> 00:13:26,314
你这么一个顶尖的女孩
You are a top-notch lady
 
307
00:13:26,348 --> 00:13:28,483
是每个男生都梦寐以求的
who any guy would be lucky to have.
 
308
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,752
现在就为进校队而努力吧
Now let's get us on that varsity squad.
 
309
00:13:30,786 --> 00:13:33,788
把我的手打成肉酱吧
Turn my hand into a bloody pulp.
 
310
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,759
暗恋我的人是乔伊·鲁尼
My secret admirer is Joey Rooney.
 
311
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,428
我的小乔伊终于要和我谈情说爱了啊
My little Joey bird finally chirped back!
 
312
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:43,765
等等  乔伊
Wait, Joey?
 
313
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:45,600
那封情书和乔伊没有半点瓜葛
There was nothing in that note about Joey...
 
314
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:49,704
我这么说是因为那是匿名信嘛
I'm assuming because you said it was a secret.
 
315
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:53,608
好几个礼拜以来
For the first time in weeks,
 
316
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:56,411
我的思想终于清晰了  我能全神贯注了
my mind is clear and I can concentrate.
 
317
00:13:56,445 --> 00:13:58,346
我是说  那明显是乔伊写的  对不
I mean, it's obviously Joey, right?
 
319
00:13:59,482 --> 00:14:01,282
好吧  我知道我应该有权解释清楚
Okay, so I know I should have come clean
 
320
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:02,550
来保护我的哥哥
right then and there to protect my brother
 
321
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:07,422
和我最好的朋友的  但我的理由是
and my best friend, but in my defense...
 
322
00:14:07,456 --> 00:14:08,423
好吧  我没啥可说的
Yeah, okay. I got nothing.
 
323
00:14:09,658 --> 00:14:12,293
当然了  对的
Sure. Yeah.
 
324
00:14:12,328 --> 00:14:13,728
怎么可能不是呢
Why not?
 
325
00:14:13,763 --> 00:14:17,365
重点是你终于走出低谷了
The point is that you are out of your slump
 
326
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,335
现在我们能为选拔赛做准备了
and now we can get you ready for tryouts.
 
327
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:21,669
等下  这个嘛
Yeah, about that.
 
328
00:14:21,704 --> 00:14:23,404
我以后不打垒球了
I'm quitting softball.
 
329
00:14:23,439 --> 00:14:25,306
什么
What?!
 
330
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:26,574
维罗  你不能这么做
Willow, you can't.
 
331
00:14:26,609 --> 00:14:28,643
情感是要耗工夫的
Relationships take work.
 
332
00:14:28,677 --> 00:14:29,778
我和乔伊的情感发展
This thing I have going on with Joey
 
333
00:14:29,812 --> 00:14:31,446
必须成为我的第一要务
has to be my top priority.
 
334
00:14:32,815 --> 00:14:34,516
等会见了  小玛
See you later, mads,
 
335
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,351
如果我还能站定的话
if I ever come back down to earth.
 
336
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:40,321
哇
Wow.
 
337
00:14:40,356 --> 00:14:42,490
看来她的乔伊病真的无药可治了
There really is no cure for a bad case of the Joeys.
