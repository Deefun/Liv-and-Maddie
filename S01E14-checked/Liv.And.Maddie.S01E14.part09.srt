239
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:22,497
埃文  我知道你没拿到蓝带
Evan, I know you're disappointed
 
240
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:23,765
失望极了
that you didn't get your blue belt.
 
241
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:25,500
说实话  我挺好的
Actually, I'm cool.
 
242
00:10:25,535 --> 00:10:27,636
我会把它看做我人生旅途的一部分
I've accepted it as a part of life's journey.
 
243
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,738
得了吧  埃文  我们是一队的
Come on, Evan. We're a team.
 
244
00:10:29,772 --> 00:10:31,473
你不可能是这么想的
That can't be how you really feel.
 
245
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,608
你说对了  是我妈让我这么说的
You're right. My mom told me to say that.
 
246
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:36,611
你想象不到我以前都把什么看做了
You wouldn't believe the things I've accepted
 
247
00:10:36,646 --> 00:10:39,514
人生旅途的一部分
as part of life's journey.
 
248
00:10:39,549 --> 00:10:41,416
但我真的很想拿到蓝腰带
But I really do want my blue belt.
 
249
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,752
那我们就要释放出你的龙之真气
Then we've got to unleash your inner dragon.
 
250
00:10:43,786 --> 00:10:45,353
你也听见老师这么讲了
You heard the sensei.
 
251
00:10:45,388 --> 00:10:46,488
如果你下节课之前
If you don't become a blue belt
 
252
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:49,357
拿不到蓝带的话  我们就要甩下你调课了
by our next class, we move on without you.
 
253
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:50,559
嘿  别因为我水平差劲
Hey, just because I stink
 
254
00:10:50,593 --> 00:10:52,494
就以为我听不懂人话
doesn't mean I don't understand English.
 
255
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:57,365
我们要让你足够愤怒
We are gonna get you angry enough
 
256
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,635
来释放你积攒已久的龙气
to release all your pent up inner aggression.
 
257
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,471
这是你妈让你带着的
This is the new balance plate lunchbox
 
258
00:11:03,506 --> 00:11:05,473
营养均衡板午餐盒  对吗
your mom made you get, right?
 
259
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:07,709
但你想不想要酷到让人大跌眼镜的
But didn't you want the cool ufc lunchbox
 
260
00:11:07,743 --> 00:11:10,612
终极格斗赛特款午餐盒呢
with the dude's eyeball falling out?
 
261
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,547
我妈认为那种太暴力了
My mom thought it was too violent.
 
262
00:11:12,582 --> 00:11:15,784
再说了  这款有个胡萝卜暖瓶呢
Plus, this one had a carrot thermos.
 
263
00:11:15,818 --> 00:11:19,487
埃文  如果你想要格斗锦标赛午餐盒
Evan, if you want that cool ufc lunchbox,
 
264
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,556
你就得把营养均衡饭盒砸了
you need to smash the balance plate.
 
265
00:11:21,591 --> 00:11:24,593
来吧  伙计  深吸一口气再呼出点火苗来
Come on, dude. Reach down deep and breathe some fire.
 
267
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:31,633
你知道的  我还是别这么做了
You know, I better not.
 
268
00:11:32,702 --> 00:11:34,469
我妈说如果我不把它带回家
Mom says if I don't bring it home,
 
269
00:11:34,503 --> 00:11:35,604
我就吃不到甜品了
I don't get my dessert.
 
270
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,372
而你是知道我多喜欢生杏仁的
And you know how I love raw almonds.
