1
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:08,168
I am calm.

2
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:10,037
I am relaxed.

3
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:13,073
I am a happy tree.

4
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:14,842
(Thuds loudly)

5
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:19,913
You are making it very hard to be a happy tree!

6
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:22,983
Sorry, Liv, I'm just... I'm losing my mind

7
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:24,952
waiting for this letter that will tell me

8
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:26,220
if I made tryouts for the junior Olympics.

9
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:28,155
Junior Olympics.

10
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,090
It's just the chance to play basketball

11
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,060
for my country and travel the world for a year

12
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:36,063
and score a bangin' team usa duffel bag.

13
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:38,799
You know what... It's no big deal.

14
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,134
It's the biggest deal ever.

15
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:42,769
Bam. What?!

16
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:45,005
I just got home and now she might be leaving

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,040
for some once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

18
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:49,243
to represent our country as a junior olympian?

19
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:50,777
(Scoffs)

20
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:51,979
How selfish can she be?

21
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:55,883
Maddie, I totally hope you do get to do your basketball audition.

22
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:56,950
(Chuckles, snorts)

23
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:58,218
Okay, well, it's called a tryout.

24
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:01,255
Well, whatever it is called, I hope you break a leg.

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,956
(Laughs)

26
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:04,958
Maddie.

27
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:06,059
This was on the porch.

28
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:07,828
(Exclaims) My letter!

29
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:09,196
I'm going to throw up. Okay.

30
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,765
Okay... you open it.

31
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,066
Don't touch it! Okay.

32
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:17,037
Okay. Ready?

33
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:20,807
Socks?

34
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:23,810
"You have been pranked by Joey."

35
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:26,813
(Laughing)

36
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:28,081
Booyah!

37
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:33,120
(Chuckling) Should be booyah.

38
00:01:34,155 --> 00:01:37,891
(Theme music plays)

39
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,226
Better in stereo

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,195
b... b... better in stereo

41
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,230
I'm up with the sunshine   let's go

42
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:46,033
I lace up my high tops   oh no

43
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,935
slam dunk   ready or not

44
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,070
yeah, show me what you got

45
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:52,940
I'm under the spotlight   holler

46
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:54,808
I dare you, come on and follow

47
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:56,944
you dance to your own beat

48
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:58,779
I'll sing the melody

49
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,014
when you say yea-ah-ah

50
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,849
I say no-oh-oh

51
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:04,084
when you say stop

52
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,187
all I want to do is go, go, go

53
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:10,824
you, you, the other half of me, me

54
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:12,859
the half I'll never be-e

55
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:16,063
the half that drives me crazy

56
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:19,132
you, you, the better half of me, me

57
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,835
the half I'll always need

58
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:23,770
but we both know

59
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:25,138
we're better in stereo.

60
00:02:25,168 --> 00:02:29,168
Synced and corrected by Katniss Everdeen www.addic7ed.com

61
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:32,212
Boom!

62
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:34,181
That is 14 in a row.

63
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:36,216
Where's your defense, little man?

64
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:43,991
It is three feet below your shoulders, that's where.

65
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:46,126
How is this even fun for you?

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,761
I'm done here.

67
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:49,062
Oh, come on. One more?

68
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,832
I'm just trying to keep my mind off Maddie and the junior Olympics.

69
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,000
I really don't want her to leave.

70
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,101
Have you heard anything?

71
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:56,770
I keep my nose out of such affairs.

72
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:59,072
Come on. One more game?

73
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:01,208
Why don't you just get Joey to play with you?

74
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:05,078
He's not leaving for his pottery class for a little while.

75
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:07,848
Wait a minute... Pottery class?

76
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:12,019
He told me he was meeting with his zombie appreciation society.

77
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,021
Wait, he's lying to us?

78
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:17,958
Why would you lie about doing either of those things?

79
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:20,861
Unless you're doing something even more pathetic.

80
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:23,196
What do you think he's up to?

81
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,831
I don't know.

82
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:27,034
Just when you think you have a munch all figured out,

83
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,803
he throws you a curveball.

84
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:33,173
Maybe he has a secret girlfriend.

85
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,842
(Both laughing)

86
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,814
Okay, look... we need to figure out what Joey's hiding.

87
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:45,919
Last time he had a secret, I woke up with 64 white mice in my bed.

88
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:49,790
Wait, so are you saying this is an affair you would stick your nose in?

89
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,191
Ah, Diggie...

90
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,026
My nose goes where it's needed.

91
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:59,900
Hey, Rooney.

92
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:01,234
Did you hear anything from the junior Olympics people?

93
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,770
Ah, no. Still no letter.

94
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:05,105
- Wow, seriously? - I said no letter!

95
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:11,178
I'm sorry, I was just hoping for good news about the tryouts.

96
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,979
Oh! Wow.

97
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:15,048
Okay, so you're saying you want me to move away for a year?

98
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,751
That's not what I'm saying at all.

99
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:18,885
Oh, okay.

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,053
So then you don't want me to make the team?

101
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:24,191
Oh, wow. No. I want what you want.

102
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:25,859
Mm-hmm.

103
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,128
Exactly as much as you want it.

104
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:32,032
Hey, Maddie.

105
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,100
Hear anything from junior Olympics?

106
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:36,737
No! I swear, if one more person...

107
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:37,904
Hey, Maddie!

108
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:39,005
Did you hear...

109
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:46,079
(Loud thuds)

110
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,049
Yes.

111
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,084
Thank you for taking the bouncing upstairs, Maddie.

112
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,019
It is so much better!

113
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:55,856
Maddie: Sorry.

114
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,924
Any sign of the mail?

115
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,827
- No. - (Loud thuds resume)

116
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:02,929
You know what... I'll check again.

117
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:07,901
Even though it's only been eight minutes since the last time.

118
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:12,906
I'm sure the mailman is standing right there about to knock.

119
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:16,943
Got a certified letter for Maddie Rooney.

120
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:18,078
Okay.

121
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:20,013
Have a good day. Bye.

122
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:24,117
Junior Olympics.

123
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,886
Maddie: Did it come?

124
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,889
Um...

125
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:31,158
Did you see that moment of hesitation

126
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:33,794
where I almost did the right thing?

127
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,061
No.

128
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:37,130
No mail here.

129
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,999
It was brief.

130
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,067
But it was there.

131
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,008
Dude, what are you wearing?

132
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:51,778
We are not following Joey into the jungle.

133
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,914
You don't know that.

134
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:58,819
So Maddie might move away and now you're dressed like a shrub.

135
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,223
I got big problems, kid.

136
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,926
Leave them at the door.

137
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,727
We have work to do.

138
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:11,731
I installed a GPS tracking app on Joey's cell phone...

139
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,900
Would you believe his password was "1234"?

140
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:15,101
What a munch.

141
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:18,138
Total munch.

142
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:22,776
Hey, can you teach me how to change the password on my phone?

143
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:36,022
(Beeping)

144
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:39,793
My GPS app just said Joey entered the school.

145
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:43,063
We just saw Joey enter the school.

146
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,865
I know.

147
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,099
This thing's good, huh?

148
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:54,741
Okay, I just don't get it.

149
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,844
Who would mysteriously sneak out at night just to come back to school?

150
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,983
A teenage superhero who uses Ridgewood high as his bat cave.

151
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:07,053
I knew his dorkiness was just too dorky to be anything but a secret identity.

152
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:08,688
(Sighs)

153
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:10,156
Dude, I can't believe I have to say this out loud,

154
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:12,692
but Joey is not a superhero.

155
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,029
Now I'm embarrassed I brought it up.

156
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,767
Someone's coming.

157
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:21,968
Hide! Hide!

158
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:34,014
Boom! Jungle.

159
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,751
You're welcome.

160
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,208
What are you two doing here?

161
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:06,780
We're superheroes and this is our bat cave?

162
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,687
I didn't open Maddie's letter,

163
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:16,756
but I struggled for hours about what to do with it.

164
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,026
In the end, I decided there really only was one right thing to do.

165
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:23,163
Hide it long enough for her to miss tryouts.

166
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:27,701
Yeah, it turns out that the toilet tank is not a great hiding place.

167
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:34,007
Mm, and...

168
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,141
There.

169
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,943
Oh, hair dryer.

170
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:39,045
Is there any problem you can't solve?

171
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,018
f-y-information, life is going to get a lot more complicated

172
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,987
for you both when you grow up.

173
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:48,855
(Knocking at door)

174
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,156
Karen: Liv, honey, can I come in?

175
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:53,193
Uh...

176
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:56,930
(Murmuring)

177
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,037
Okay, yeah. Come on in.

178
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,973
Hey.

179
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:08,808
How are you doing?

180
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,844
Oh! So good. I am phenomenal.

181
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,746
I am just great.

182
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,913
(Loud thuds)

183
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:18,752
(Sighs) Poor Maddie has been out on that basketball court all night.

184
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:21,154
She is so anxious waiting for this letter to arrive.

185
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:23,790
It's just cruel that they make her wait so long.

186
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,892
It is so cruel.

187
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,861
(Louder thuds)

188
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,964
(Sighs)

189
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:35,769
I have just been a nervous wreck thinking about another one of my babies

190
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:36,870
leaving the nest.

191
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:38,772
But you, you're right there.

192
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,106
Supporting your sister.

193
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,709
It's just like this picture you two made.

194
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,745
"Sisters by chance, friends by choice."

195
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,982
You know... you girls live that every day.

196
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,850
Every day?

197
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,020
Ha ha! Twice on Sundays.

198
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:58,191
Oh, I remember the night you were leaving for Hollywood.

199
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:07,033
(Sighing)

200
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:09,102
Mom, mom, guess what.

201
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:10,770
What is it, Maddie?

202
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:14,074
We played basketball at recess today and I was better than everyone.

203
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,875
Even the boys. Bam!

204
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,943
- What? - Bam!

205
00:10:16,977 --> 00:10:18,945
What?

206
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,980
Ooh, I like that.

207
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,115
Bam! What?!

208
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:31,891
What is happening?

209
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:35,061
Joey, Parker just follows you around

210
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:36,963
because he worships the ground you walk on.

211
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:39,132
It is cute that he can't take his eyes off of you.

212
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,936
So that's why he poops with the door open.

213
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,805
He'll grow out of that.

214
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,209
Appreciate the offer.

215
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:50,810
What offer?

216
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:54,814
Bluetoothin', babe gotta bail, brah.

217
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:59,219
Okay, here's aunt Dina's number in case you need to get ahold of us in L.A.

218
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:00,820
Keep it someplace safe.

219
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:03,123
Got it.

220
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:05,992
There she is. Look out, Hollywood.

221
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:09,129
It is Liv Rooney.

222
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:11,831
I had the most amaze-a-licious idea.

223
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:15,168
Instead of saying the name of my show, I should always sing it.

224
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:18,104
Sing it loud!

225
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,842
That's gonna get old.

226
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:24,744
Gonna?

227
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,112
All right, everybody.

228
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,748
Time to take mom and Liv to the airport.

229
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:31,785
Wait. I need a twin moment.

230
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:32,886
Are they gonna hug or fight?

231
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,754
I never know.

232
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,791
Look, I could be gone for a long time.

233
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,759
You say the word and I won't leave.

234
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:40,994
You have to go, Liv.

235
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:42,829
I'm going to miss you.

236
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:44,164
But this is your dream.

237
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,935
Thanks. That means everything to me.

238
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:52,939
Now go out and show Hollywood how we do it in Stevens Point.

239
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,842
Bam! What?!

240
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,877
Yeah, don't do that.

241
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,814
(Both chuckle)

242
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,751
Wow. (Laughs)

243
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,085
Thank you, mom.

244
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,955
Really needed that reminder of how selfless my sister was.

245
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:12,058
I would be a monster not to do the same thing for her.

246
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,894
Oh, a hideous monster.

247
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,089
All righty.

248
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:21,257
You figured out my secret.

249
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,126
I'm in a drum circle.

250
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,895
We're called the bucketstreet boys.

251
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:29,866
Go ahead. Make fun.

252
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,968
Joey, that was awesome.

253
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:36,139
And you know I die a little inside every time I compliment you.

254
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,342
I was really impressed too, Joe.

255
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,344
Yeah, no one's taking you seriously right now, Diggie.

256
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:44,313
Stand down, soldier.

257
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,150
Stand down.

258
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,286
So what's with the sneaking around?

259
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,122
Well, you know, some of my guys are a little shy.

260
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,927
A lot shy.

261
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:01,064
So we've been rehearsing in private.

262
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:05,902
But we're going public tomorrow between fifth and sixth period.

263
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:08,171
Whoa... that's hallway rush hour.

264
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,305
That's the point.

265
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:12,075
We're gonna stop traffic with our insta-jam

266
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:15,311
and pick up some insta-hallway cred.

267
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:21,184
That's cool. I mean, you just became slightly less munchy.

268
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,922
I just don't get why you keep the one thing you do well a secret.

269
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:28,024
(Scoffs) One thing.

270
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:32,895
Clearly you have never seen me give medicine to a cat.

271
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:37,900
(Loud thuds)

272
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,242
Maddie couldn't sleep so she was practicing free throws.

273
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,077
Whatever those are.

274
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:50,313
And have you ever noticed how a bouncing basketball

275
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:54,917
sounds like guilty secrets trying to pound their way out of your skull?

276
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,018
(Thuds continue)

277
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:59,989
Young Liv: Sisters by chance... Young Maddie: Friends by choice.

278
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:03,960
Young Liv: Sisters by chance... Young Maddie: Friends by choice.

279
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:07,830
What... is... happening?

280
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,101
Sisters by chance... Friends by choice.

281
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:15,204
Sisters by chance... Friends by choice.

282
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:19,108
Both: Sisters by chance, friends by choice.

283
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:23,312
I felt like the picture was trying to tell me something.

284
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:26,983
And it seems to me that if a picture comes to life,

285
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,918
you should probably listen to it.

286
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,888
Both: Give her the letter!

287
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:34,023
Fine.

288
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:37,193
But you had better be asleep by the time I get back, young ladies.

289
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,399
Maddie!

290
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,566
Look what just came. (Squeals)

291
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:46,402
It's your letter from the junior Olympics.

292
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,303
Oh, finally!

293
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,339
(Laughs)

294
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,475
Wait, this just got here?

295
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,677
It's midnight.

296
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:57,780
Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,583
Yeah, it's this new feature that the post office has

298
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:03,452
where they wait until the last second

299
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,688
to deliver something important to build excitement.

300
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:07,389
It's called...

301
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:10,359
It's called "antici-post."

302
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:11,627
Liv...

303
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,264
When did this letter really get here?

304
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:16,632
Okay, so it got here this morning.

305
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,367
What?!

306
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,501
You had this all day?

307
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:22,571
Hey! You cannot blame the messenger.

308
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:26,308
Well, I can if the messenger never gave me the message.

309
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,544
Now, what is going on out here?

310
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:31,313
Liv hid my junior Olympics letter all day!

311
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,649
What?! Olivia Rooney.

312
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:37,519
Yeah, you see that... That is the face of an appalled mother.

313
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:40,656
You appalled her because you are appalling.

314
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,493
I wouldn't say mom looked appalled.

315
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,661
She just looks kind of worn out.

316
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,396
(Sputters)

317
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,332
Liv, you tried to sabotage me.

318
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,601
I would never sabotage your dream like that.

319
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,771
Well, now, Madison, that's not totally true.

320
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,641
Do you remember five years ago?

321
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:01,477
Liv's audition DVD?

322
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,446
We are not talking about five years ago, Karen.

323
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:09,585
No, I think I'd like to hear Karen's story.

324
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,258
Say goodbye to Hollywood, Liv.

325
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,360
Maddie, stop. What are you doing?

326
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,596
I'm destroying Liv's audition video.

327
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,431
I don't want her to leave.

328
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:24,333
Honey, no.

329
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:28,403
No, I know this is going to be hard, but this is Liv's dream.

330
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:29,638
We have to let her try.

331
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:32,674
If she doesn't, she will always wonder what might have happened.

332
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,476
You're right, mom.

333
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:38,514
I once passed up a chance to move to Indianapolis

334
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:42,417
to fill a coveted spot in a regional production of "Oliver"

335
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:45,387
as street urchin #3.

336
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,422
(With British accent) I carry that regret with me

337
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,658
every single day of me life.

338
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,465
You almost destroyed my audition DVD?

339
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:58,300
- Liv, I... - No, no.

340
00:16:58,334 --> 00:16:59,601
Ha! It's cool.

341
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:02,538
Wow, for a while there, I thought I was the evil twin.

342
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:04,339
But it turns out we're both evil.

343
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:06,542
Samesies!

344
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:09,378
You can't call samesies.

345
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:10,546
I was like 10.

346
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,447
Okay.

347
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:16,552
I think we should focus less on the evil that you share and more on the love.

348
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:19,421
Neither one of you wanted the other one to leave.

349
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,324
(Sighs) Maddie, she's right.

350
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:25,260
I mean, I moved back to Wisconsin to be with you.

351
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,495
I'm not ready to let you go.

352
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,732
So yeah. I hid your letter.

353
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,367
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,604
Well, I mean...

355
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,707
I get it. Your heart was in the right place.

356
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:42,744
Liv, just know that whatever is in this letter...

357
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,713
We're never going to lose what we have.

358
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,415
That's right.

359
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:50,485
You'll always be sisters by chance, friends by choice.

360
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,488
Yeah, so let's not say that out loud anymore.

361
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:56,391
(Sighs) Open your letter.

362
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,459
Open the letter.

363
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,361
Diggie: Yeah, open the letter.

364
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:00,596
Okay, fine, I will...

365
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,297
Diggie?

366
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,300
What are you doing here?

367
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,269
Just walking by. Thought I'd say hello.

368
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:11,506
Oh. (Chuckles) Weird. But sweet.

369
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:15,377
All: Open the letter.

370
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,246
(Clears throat)

371
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,580
I made tryouts.

372
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,315
I made tryouts!

373
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,352
(Exclaiming)

374
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:25,387
This is huge.

375
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,356
I am so proud of you.

376
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,660
Wait, I have to be in Chicago for tryouts in six hours?

377
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,396
I'm never gonna make that.

378
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,497
Six hours?

379
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,432
Oh! Six hours.

380
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:38,734
What have I done? Okay.

381
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,435
Um, no no no. You know what?

382
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,438
I can help. I can have you packed in 5 1/2.

383
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:45,340
Whoo!

384
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,342
Huh.

385
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,744
This says tryouts are next weekend.

386
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:51,380
(Laughs, snorts)

387
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:52,714
I know.

388
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:54,750
Oh, but did you see her jump?

389
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,655
(Laughs) Maybe I am the evil twin.

390
00:19:06,496 --> 00:19:07,562
(Quiet chatter)

391
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:10,265
Am I too late for the insta-jam?

392
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,633
I got a bathroom hall pass from my teacher,

393
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:14,336
but I didn't tell her what bathroom.

394
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,606
Guys, you made it.

395
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,710
By the time sixth period starts, you'll be able to say, "Joey Rooney...

396
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,645
I knew him when."

397
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,649
(Bell rings)

398
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,719
Attention, Ridgewood!

399
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,556
Get ready to get rhythm!

400
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,461
1, 2, 3, 4.

401
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:43,298
Really?

402
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:47,502
Seriously, now is not the time to be shy.

403
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,273
Oh, man, this is terrible.

404
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:52,274
We have to do something.

405
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:53,375
You're right.

406
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,744
I have an immobilizing dart gun in my pocket.

407
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,579
We can say he was dehydrated.

408
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:01,316
I think I have a better idea.

409
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:07,656
Thanks, man.

410
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,434
Now, are you guys drummers?

411
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,304
Or are you bummers?

412
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,407
Well, the joke is on you.

413
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:28,677
Because Joey's out there with the captain of the basketball team.

414
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:33,482
And you guys are just standing here, getting lectured by a fifth grader.

415
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,788
Hey, Joey, we got the band back together.

416
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,324
Oh ho ho!

417
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,527
All righty.

418
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,496
1, 2, 3, 4.

419
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,768
(Inaudible over drumming)

420
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,445
(Cheering)

421
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:07,749
- Way to go, Joey! - Not now, Diggie.

422
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,684
They love me.

423
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,758
(Gasps) Oh.

424
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:19,528
So how'd it go?

425
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:20,595
Did you make the team?

426
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,399
Well, they said she had a lot of potential.

427
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:27,736
And she was one of only three sophomores invited to try out.

428
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,639
Yeah, they... they said I did a really great job

429
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:33,608
and they said for me to keep practicing.

430
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:37,345
- Oh, Maddie. - I'm so sorry.

431
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,648
Yeah, because we start in ten weeks.

432
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:40,782
I made the team!

433
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,552
Bam! What?!

434
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,353
Did you see their faces?

435
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,722
I didn't give it away. I didn't give it away!

436
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,494
Oh, Maddie, I am so proud of you.

437
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,564
Thanks, mom.

438
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:58,467
Wow, I'm really going to miss you, Rooney.

439
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:02,337
But I'll be here waiting for you when you come back.

440
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:03,538
(Chuckles) Thanks, Diggie.

441
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,540
(Mockingly clears throat) No way.

442
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,409
Ahem!

443
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:11,713
So, um...

444
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,449
I could be gone for a really long time.

445
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:15,550
You just say the word...

446
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,751
Don't go! Forget your dreams.

447
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,455
What?

448
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,357
I'm totally kidding. You have to go.

449
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:24,292
I already made plans for your half of the room.

450
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,501
Thank you for watching my audition video.

451
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:36,538
I would love to be your Stephanie Einstein on "Sing it loud!"

452
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,406
(Laughing)

453
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,741
That was great, honey.

454
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,412
Now you go on up to bed and we will mail this out tomorrow.

455
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:44,379
Thanks Mom.

456
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:45,446
(Chuckles) Okay.

457
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:46,744
Sleep well, honey.

458
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,335
Hello Hollywood.

459
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,130
Hope you enjoyed Liv. She's adorable.

460
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:55,401
But while we have you here,

461
00:22:55,412 --> 00:23:00,558
I'd like to throw my hat in the ring for Stephanie's mom, Alberta Einstein.

462
00:23:00,772 --> 00:23:05,149
Now, I don't have a script, but here's how I imagine this character would be.

463
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:07,964
(Sighs)

464
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,571
(With British accent) Hello.

465
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:13,838
Well, I didn't see you there.

466
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:17,885
The name's Einstein. (Chuckles) Alberta Einstein.

467
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:20,381
Pete:  Hey, honey, You want some popcorn?

468
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:22,151
Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

469
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:28,136
Again, I hope you'll consider Karen Rooney for the role of Alberta Einstein.

470
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:28,763
Thanks.

471
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:30,291
(With British accent) Cheers.
