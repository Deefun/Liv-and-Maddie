1
00:00:05,934 --> 00:00:08,168
I am calm.

2
00:00:08,203 --> 00:00:10,037
I am relaxed.

3
00:00:10,071 --> 00:00:13,073
I am a happy tree.

4
00:00:13,108 --> 00:00:14,842
(Thuds loudly)

5
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:19,913
You are making it very hard to be a happy tree!

6
00:00:19,948 --> 00:00:22,983
Sorry, Liv, I'm just... I'm losing my mind

7
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:24,952
waiting for this letter that will tell me

8
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:26,220
if I made tryouts for the junior Olympics.

9
00:00:26,254 --> 00:00:28,155
Junior Olympics.

10
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,090
It's just the chance to play basketball

11
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:33,060
for my country and travel the world for a year

12
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:36,063
and score a bangin' team usa duffel bag.

13
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:38,799
You know what... It's no big deal.

14
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,134
It's the biggest deal ever.

15
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:42,769
Bam. What?!

16
00:00:42,804 --> 00:00:45,005
I just got home and now she might be leaving

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,040
for some once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

18
00:00:47,075 --> 00:00:49,243
to represent our country as a junior olympian?

19
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:50,777
(Scoffs)

20
00:00:50,812 --> 00:00:51,979
How selfish can she be?

21
00:00:53,014 --> 00:00:55,883
Maddie, I totally hope you do get to do your basketball audition.

22
00:00:55,917 --> 00:00:56,950
(Chuckles, snorts)

23
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:58,218
Okay, well, it's called a tryout.

24
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:01,255
Well, whatever it is called, I hope you break a leg.

25
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:02,956
(Laughs)

26
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:04,958
Maddie.

27
00:01:04,993 --> 00:01:06,059
This was on the porch.

28
00:01:06,094 --> 00:01:07,828
(Exclaims) My letter!

29
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:09,196
I'm going to throw up. Okay.

30
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:11,765
Okay... you open it.

31
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,066
Don't touch it! Okay.

32
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:17,037
Okay. Ready?

33
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:20,807
Socks?

34
00:01:20,842 --> 00:01:23,810
"You have been pranked by Joey."

35
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:26,813
(Laughing)

36
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:28,081
Booyah!

37
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:33,120
(Chuckling) Should be booyah.
