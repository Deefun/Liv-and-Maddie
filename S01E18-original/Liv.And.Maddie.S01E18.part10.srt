272
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:46,242
Maddie couldn't sleep so she was practicing free throws.

273
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:48,077
Whatever those are.

274
00:13:48,112 --> 00:13:50,313
And have you ever noticed how a bouncing basketball

275
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:54,917
sounds like guilty secrets trying to pound their way out of your skull?

276
00:13:54,952 --> 00:13:56,018
(Thuds continue)

277
00:13:56,053 --> 00:13:59,989
Young Liv: Sisters by chance... Young Maddie: Friends by choice.

278
00:14:00,023 --> 00:14:03,960
Young Liv: Sisters by chance... Young Maddie: Friends by choice.

279
00:14:03,994 --> 00:14:07,830
What... is... happening?

280
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,101
Sisters by chance... Friends by choice.

281
00:14:12,136 --> 00:14:15,204
Sisters by chance... Friends by choice.

282
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:19,108
Both: Sisters by chance, friends by choice.

283
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:23,312
I felt like the picture was trying to tell me something.

284
00:14:23,347 --> 00:14:26,983
And it seems to me that if a picture comes to life,

285
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,918
you should probably listen to it.

286
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,888
Both: Give her the letter!

287
00:14:31,922 --> 00:14:34,023
Fine.

288
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:37,193
But you had better be asleep by the time I get back, young ladies.
