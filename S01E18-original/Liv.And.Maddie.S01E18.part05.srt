110
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,049
Yes.

111
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,084
Thank you for taking the bouncing upstairs, Maddie.

112
00:04:51,119 --> 00:04:53,019
It is so much better!

113
00:04:54,789 --> 00:04:55,856
Maddie: Sorry.

114
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:57,924
Any sign of the mail?

115
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,827
- No. - (Loud thuds resume)

116
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:02,929
You know what... I'll check again.

117
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:07,901
Even though it's only been eight minutes since the last time.

118
00:05:07,935 --> 00:05:12,906
I'm sure the mailman is standing right there about to knock.

119
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:16,943
Got a certified letter for Maddie Rooney.

120
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:18,078
Okay.

121
00:05:18,112 --> 00:05:20,013
Have a good day. Bye.

122
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:24,117
Junior Olympics.

123
00:05:24,152 --> 00:05:25,886
Maddie: Did it come?

124
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,889
Um...

125
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:31,158
Did you see that moment of hesitation

126
00:05:31,192 --> 00:05:33,794
where I almost did the right thing?

127
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:35,061
No.

128
00:05:35,096 --> 00:05:37,130
No mail here.

129
00:05:37,165 --> 00:05:38,999
It was brief.

130
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:41,067
But it was there.
