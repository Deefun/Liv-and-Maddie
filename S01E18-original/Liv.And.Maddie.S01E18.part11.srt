289
00:14:41,731 --> 00:14:43,399
Maddie!

290
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,566
Look what just came. (Squeals)

291
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:46,402
It's your letter from the junior Olympics.

292
00:14:46,436 --> 00:14:48,303
Oh, finally!

293
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,339
(Laughs)

294
00:14:51,741 --> 00:14:53,475
Wait, this just got here?

295
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,677
It's midnight.

296
00:14:54,711 --> 00:14:57,780
Yeah. Yeah.

297
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:01,583
Yeah, it's this new feature that the post office has

298
00:15:01,618 --> 00:15:03,452
where they wait until the last second

299
00:15:03,486 --> 00:15:05,688
to deliver something important to build excitement.

300
00:15:05,722 --> 00:15:07,389
It's called...

301
00:15:07,424 --> 00:15:10,359
It's called "antici-post."

302
00:15:10,393 --> 00:15:11,627
Liv...

303
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:15,264
When did this letter really get here?

304
00:15:15,298 --> 00:15:16,632
Okay, so it got here this morning.

305
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,367
What?!

306
00:15:18,401 --> 00:15:19,501
You had this all day?

307
00:15:19,536 --> 00:15:22,571
Hey! You cannot blame the messenger.

308
00:15:22,605 --> 00:15:26,308
Well, I can if the messenger never gave me the message.

309
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,544
Now, what is going on out here?

310
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:31,313
Liv hid my junior Olympics letter all day!

311
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,649
What?! Olivia Rooney.

312
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:37,519
Yeah, you see that... That is the face of an appalled mother.

313
00:15:37,554 --> 00:15:40,656
You appalled her because you are appalling.

314
00:15:42,425 --> 00:15:44,493
I wouldn't say mom looked appalled.

315
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,661
She just looks kind of worn out.

316
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:47,396
(Sputters)

317
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:50,332
Liv, you tried to sabotage me.

318
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,601
I would never sabotage your dream like that.

319
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:55,771
Well, now, Madison, that's not totally true.

320
00:15:57,607 --> 00:15:59,641
Do you remember five years ago?

321
00:15:59,676 --> 00:16:01,477
Liv's audition DVD?

322
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:04,446
We are not talking about five years ago, Karen.

323
00:16:05,682 --> 00:16:09,585
No, I think I'd like to hear Karen's story.

324
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:16,258
Say goodbye to Hollywood, Liv.

325
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:18,360
Maddie, stop. What are you doing?

326
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,596
I'm destroying Liv's audition video.

327
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:22,431
I don't want her to leave.

328
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:24,333
Honey, no.

329
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:28,403
No, I know this is going to be hard, but this is Liv's dream.

330
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:29,638
We have to let her try.

331
00:16:29,672 --> 00:16:32,674
If she doesn't, she will always wonder what might have happened.

332
00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:34,476
You're right, mom.

333
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:38,514
I once passed up a chance to move to Indianapolis

334
00:16:38,548 --> 00:16:42,417
to fill a coveted spot in a regional production of "Oliver"

335
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:45,387
as street urchin #3.

336
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,422
(With British accent) I carry that regret with me

337
00:16:47,457 --> 00:16:49,658
every single day of me life.

338
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:56,465
You almost destroyed my audition DVD?

339
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:58,300
- Liv, I... - No, no.

340
00:16:58,334 --> 00:16:59,601
Ha! It's cool.

341
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:02,538
Wow, for a while there, I thought I was the evil twin.

342
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:04,339
But it turns out we're both evil.

343
00:17:04,374 --> 00:17:06,542
Samesies!

344
00:17:06,576 --> 00:17:09,378
You can't call samesies.

345
00:17:09,412 --> 00:17:10,546
I was like 10.

346
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,447
Okay.

347
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:16,552
I think we should focus less on the evil that you share and more on the love.

348
00:17:16,586 --> 00:17:19,421
Neither one of you wanted the other one to leave.

349
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,324
(Sighs) Maddie, she's right.

350
00:17:22,358 --> 00:17:25,260
I mean, I moved back to Wisconsin to be with you.

351
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,495
I'm not ready to let you go.

352
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,732
So yeah. I hid your letter.

353
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,367
I'm sorry.

354
00:17:33,736 --> 00:17:35,604
Well, I mean...

355
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:38,707
I get it. Your heart was in the right place.

356
00:17:38,741 --> 00:17:42,744
Liv, just know that whatever is in this letter...

357
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:44,713
We're never going to lose what we have.

358
00:17:44,747 --> 00:17:46,415
That's right.

359
00:17:46,449 --> 00:17:50,485
You'll always be sisters by chance, friends by choice.

360
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,488
Yeah, so let's not say that out loud anymore.

361
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:56,391
(Sighs) Open your letter.

362
00:17:56,426 --> 00:17:57,459
Open the letter.

363
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,361
Diggie: Yeah, open the letter.

364
00:17:59,395 --> 00:18:00,596
Okay, fine, I will...

365
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,297
Diggie?

366
00:18:03,766 --> 00:18:05,300
What are you doing here?

367
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,269
Just walking by. Thought I'd say hello.

368
00:18:08,404 --> 00:18:11,506
Oh. (Chuckles) Weird. But sweet.

369
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:15,377
All: Open the letter.

370
00:18:15,411 --> 00:18:17,246
(Clears throat)

371
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,580
I made tryouts.

372
00:18:18,615 --> 00:18:20,315
I made tryouts!

373
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,352
(Exclaiming)

374
00:18:23,386 --> 00:18:25,387
This is huge.

375
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,356
I am so proud of you.

376
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:31,660
Wait, I have to be in Chicago for tryouts in six hours?

377
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,396
I'm never gonna make that.

378
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,497
Six hours?

379
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,432
Oh! Six hours.

380
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:38,734
What have I done? Okay.

381
00:18:38,768 --> 00:18:40,435
Um, no no no. You know what?

382
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:43,438
I can help. I can have you packed in 5 1/2.

383
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:45,340
Whoo!

384
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,342
Huh.

385
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,744
This says tryouts are next weekend.

386
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:51,380
(Laughs, snorts)

387
00:18:51,414 --> 00:18:52,714
I know.

388
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:54,750
Oh, but did you see her jump?

389
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:59,655
(Laughs) Maybe I am the evil twin.
