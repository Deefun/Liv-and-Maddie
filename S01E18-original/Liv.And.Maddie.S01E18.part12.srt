391
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:10,265
Am I too late for the insta-jam?

392
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,633
I got a bathroom hall pass from my teacher,

393
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:14,336
but I didn't tell her what bathroom.

394
00:19:15,371 --> 00:19:17,606
Guys, you made it.

395
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,710
By the time sixth period starts, you'll be able to say, "Joey Rooney...

396
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:23,645
I knew him when."

397
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,649
(Bell rings)

398
00:19:27,684 --> 00:19:30,719
Attention, Ridgewood!

399
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:34,556
Get ready to get rhythm!

400
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,461
1, 2, 3, 4.

401
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:43,298
Really?

402
00:19:44,634 --> 00:19:47,502
Seriously, now is not the time to be shy.

403
00:19:49,472 --> 00:19:51,273
Oh, man, this is terrible.

404
00:19:51,307 --> 00:19:52,274
We have to do something.

405
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:53,375
You're right.

406
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,744
I have an immobilizing dart gun in my pocket.

407
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:57,579
We can say he was dehydrated.

408
00:19:59,716 --> 00:20:01,316
I think I have a better idea.

409
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:07,656
Thanks, man.

410
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,434
Now, are you guys drummers?

411
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,304
Or are you bummers?

412
00:20:23,706 --> 00:20:25,407
Well, the joke is on you.

413
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:28,677
Because Joey's out there with the captain of the basketball team.

414
00:20:28,711 --> 00:20:33,482
And you guys are just standing here, getting lectured by a fifth grader.

415
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,788
Hey, Joey, we got the band back together.

416
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:42,324
Oh ho ho!

417
00:20:43,593 --> 00:20:45,527
All righty.

418
00:20:45,561 --> 00:20:47,496
1, 2, 3, 4.

419
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,768
(Inaudible over drumming)

420
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,445
(Cheering)

421
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:07,749
- Way to go, Joey! - Not now, Diggie.

422
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,684
They love me.
