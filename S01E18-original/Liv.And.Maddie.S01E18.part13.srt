423
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:16,758
(Gasps) Oh.

424
00:21:16,793 --> 00:21:19,528
So how'd it go?

425
00:21:19,562 --> 00:21:20,595
Did you make the team?

426
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,399
Well, they said she had a lot of potential.

427
00:21:24,434 --> 00:21:27,736
And she was one of only three sophomores invited to try out.

428
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,639
Yeah, they... they said I did a really great job

429
00:21:30,673 --> 00:21:33,608
and they said for me to keep practicing.

430
00:21:33,643 --> 00:21:37,345
- Oh, Maddie. - I'm so sorry.

431
00:21:37,413 --> 00:21:39,648
Yeah, because we start in ten weeks.

432
00:21:39,682 --> 00:21:40,782
I made the team!

433
00:21:40,817 --> 00:21:43,552
Bam! What?!

434
00:21:43,586 --> 00:21:45,353
Did you see their faces?

435
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:47,722
I didn't give it away. I didn't give it away!

436
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,494
Oh, Maddie, I am so proud of you.

437
00:21:52,528 --> 00:21:55,564
Thanks, mom.

438
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:58,467
Wow, I'm really going to miss you, Rooney.

439
00:21:58,501 --> 00:22:02,337
But I'll be here waiting for you when you come back.

440
00:22:02,371 --> 00:22:03,538
(Chuckles) Thanks, Diggie.

441
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:05,540
(Mockingly clears throat) No way.

442
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,409
Ahem!

443
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:11,713
So, um...

444
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,449
I could be gone for a really long time.

445
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:15,550
You just say the word...

446
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:16,751
Don't go! Forget your dreams.

447
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,455
What?

448
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,357
I'm totally kidding. You have to go.

449
00:22:22,391 --> 00:22:24,292
I already made plans for your half of the room.
