61
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:32,212
Boom!

62
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:34,181
That is 14 in a row.

63
00:02:34,215 --> 00:02:36,216
Where's your defense, little man?

64
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:43,991
It is three feet below your shoulders, that's where.

65
00:02:44,025 --> 00:02:46,126
How is this even fun for you?

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,761
I'm done here.

67
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:49,062
Oh, come on. One more?

68
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,832
I'm just trying to keep my mind off Maddie and the junior Olympics.

69
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,000
I really don't want her to leave.

70
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,101
Have you heard anything?

71
00:02:54,135 --> 00:02:56,770
I keep my nose out of such affairs.

72
00:02:57,972 --> 00:02:59,072
Come on. One more game?

73
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:01,208
Why don't you just get Joey to play with you?

74
00:03:01,242 --> 00:03:05,078
He's not leaving for his pottery class for a little while.

75
00:03:05,113 --> 00:03:07,848
Wait a minute... Pottery class?

76
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:12,019
He told me he was meeting with his zombie appreciation society.

77
00:03:12,053 --> 00:03:14,021
Wait, he's lying to us?

78
00:03:14,055 --> 00:03:17,958
Why would you lie about doing either of those things?

79
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:20,861
Unless you're doing something even more pathetic.

80
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:23,196
What do you think he's up to?

81
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,831
I don't know.

82
00:03:24,866 --> 00:03:27,034
Just when you think you have a munch all figured out,

83
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:29,803
he throws you a curveball.

84
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:33,173
Maybe he has a secret girlfriend.

85
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,842
(Both laughing)

86
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:40,814
Okay, look... we need to figure out what Joey's hiding.

87
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:45,919
Last time he had a secret, I woke up with 64 white mice in my bed.

88
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:49,790
Wait, so are you saying this is an affair you would stick your nose in?

89
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,191
Ah, Diggie...

90
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,026
My nose goes where it's needed.
