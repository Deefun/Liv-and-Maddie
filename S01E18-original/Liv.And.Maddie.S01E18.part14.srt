450
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,501
Thank you for watching my audition video.

451
00:22:32,535 --> 00:22:36,538
I would love to be your Stephanie Einstein on "Sing it loud!"

452
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:38,406
(Laughing)

453
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:39,741
That was great, honey.

454
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,412
Now you go on up to bed and we will mail this out tomorrow.

455
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:44,379
Thanks Mom.

456
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:45,446
(Chuckles) Okay.

457
00:22:45,468 --> 00:22:46,744
Sleep well, honey.

458
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:49,335
Hello Hollywood.

459
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,130
Hope you enjoyed Liv. She's adorable.

460
00:22:54,158 --> 00:22:55,401
But while we have you here,

461
00:22:55,412 --> 00:23:00,558
I'd like to throw my hat in the ring for Stephanie's mom, Alberta Einstein.

462
00:23:00,772 --> 00:23:05,149
Now, I don't have a script, but here's how I imagine this character would be.

463
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:07,964
(Sighs)

464
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,571
(With British accent) Hello.

465
00:23:12,485 --> 00:23:13,838
Well, I didn't see you there.

466
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:17,885
The name's Einstein. (Chuckles) Alberta Einstein.

467
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:20,381
Pete:  Hey, honey, You want some popcorn?

468
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:22,151
Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

469
00:23:24,221 --> 00:23:28,136
Again, I hope you'll consider Karen Rooney for the role of Alberta Einstein.

470
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:28,763
Thanks.

471
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:30,291
(With British accent) Cheers.
