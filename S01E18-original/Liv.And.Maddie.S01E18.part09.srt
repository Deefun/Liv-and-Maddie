247
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,089
All righty.

248
00:12:20,124 --> 00:12:21,257
You figured out my secret.

249
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,126
I'm in a drum circle.

250
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,895
We're called the bucketstreet boys.

251
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:29,866
Go ahead. Make fun.

252
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,968
Joey, that was awesome.

253
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:36,139
And you know I die a little inside every time I compliment you.

254
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:39,342
I was really impressed too, Joe.

255
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,344
Yeah, no one's taking you seriously right now, Diggie.

256
00:12:42,913 --> 00:12:44,313
Stand down, soldier.

257
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:47,150
Stand down.

258
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:50,286
So what's with the sneaking around?

259
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,122
Well, you know, some of my guys are a little shy.

260
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:57,927
A lot shy.

261
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:01,064
So we've been rehearsing in private.

262
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:05,902
But we're going public tomorrow between fifth and sixth period.

263
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:08,171
Whoa... that's hallway rush hour.

264
00:13:08,205 --> 00:13:09,305
That's the point.

265
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:12,075
We're gonna stop traffic with our insta-jam

266
00:13:12,109 --> 00:13:15,311
and pick up some insta-hallway cred.

267
00:13:17,014 --> 00:13:21,184
That's cool. I mean, you just became slightly less munchy.

268
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,922
I just don't get why you keep the one thing you do well a secret.

269
00:13:25,956 --> 00:13:28,024
(Scoffs) One thing.

270
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:32,895
Clearly you have never seen me give medicine to a cat.
