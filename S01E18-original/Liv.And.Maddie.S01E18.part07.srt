144
00:06:36,057 --> 00:06:39,793
My GPS app just said Joey entered the school.

145
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:43,063
We just saw Joey enter the school.

146
00:06:43,097 --> 00:06:44,865
I know.

147
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:46,099
This thing's good, huh?

148
00:06:53,107 --> 00:06:54,741
Okay, I just don't get it.

149
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:57,844
Who would mysteriously sneak out at night just to come back to school?

150
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,983
A teenage superhero who uses Ridgewood high as his bat cave.

151
00:07:03,017 --> 00:07:07,053
I knew his dorkiness was just too dorky to be anything but a secret identity.

152
00:07:07,088 --> 00:07:08,688
(Sighs)

153
00:07:08,723 --> 00:07:10,156
Dude, I can't believe I have to say this out loud,

154
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:12,692
but Joey is not a superhero.

155
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,029
Now I'm embarrassed I brought it up.

156
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,767
Someone's coming.

157
00:07:20,801 --> 00:07:21,968
Hide! Hide!

158
00:07:31,946 --> 00:07:34,014
Boom! Jungle.

159
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,751
You're welcome.

160
00:08:01,108 --> 00:08:02,208
What are you two doing here?

161
00:08:02,243 --> 00:08:06,780
We're superheroes and this is our bat cave?
