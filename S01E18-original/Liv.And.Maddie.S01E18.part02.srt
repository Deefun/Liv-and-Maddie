39
00:01:37,926 --> 00:01:39,226
Better in stereo

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,195
b... b... better in stereo

41
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:43,230
I'm up with the sunshine   let's go

42
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:46,033
I lace up my high tops   oh no

43
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,935
slam dunk   ready or not

44
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:50,070
yeah, show me what you got

45
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:52,940
I'm under the spotlight   holler

46
00:01:52,974 --> 00:01:54,808
I dare you, come on and follow

47
00:01:54,842 --> 00:01:56,944
you dance to your own beat

48
00:01:56,978 --> 00:01:58,779
I'll sing the melody

49
00:01:58,813 --> 00:02:01,014
when you say yea-ah-ah

50
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:02,849
I say no-oh-oh

51
00:02:02,884 --> 00:02:04,084
when you say stop

52
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:07,187
all I want to do is go, go, go

53
00:02:07,222 --> 00:02:10,824
you, you, the other half of me, me

54
00:02:10,858 --> 00:02:12,859
the half I'll never be-e

55
00:02:12,894 --> 00:02:16,063
the half that drives me crazy

56
00:02:16,097 --> 00:02:19,132
you, you, the better half of me, me

57
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:21,835
the half I'll always need

58
00:02:21,869 --> 00:02:23,770
but we both know

59
00:02:23,805 --> 00:02:25,138
we're better in stereo.
