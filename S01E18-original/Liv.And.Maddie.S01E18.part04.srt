91
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:59,900
Hey, Rooney.

92
00:03:59,934 --> 00:04:01,234
Did you hear anything from the junior Olympics people?

93
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,770
Ah, no. Still no letter.

94
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:05,105
- Wow, seriously? - I said no letter!

95
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:11,178
I'm sorry, I was just hoping for good news about the tryouts.

96
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,979
Oh! Wow.

97
00:04:13,014 --> 00:04:15,048
Okay, so you're saying you want me to move away for a year?

98
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,751
That's not what I'm saying at all.

99
00:04:17,785 --> 00:04:18,885
Oh, okay.

100
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,053
So then you don't want me to make the team?

101
00:04:20,088 --> 00:04:24,191
Oh, wow. No. I want what you want.

102
00:04:24,225 --> 00:04:25,859
Mm-hmm.

103
00:04:25,893 --> 00:04:28,128
Exactly as much as you want it.

104
00:04:30,865 --> 00:04:32,032
Hey, Maddie.

105
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,100
Hear anything from junior Olympics?

106
00:04:33,134 --> 00:04:36,737
No! I swear, if one more person...

107
00:04:36,771 --> 00:04:37,904
Hey, Maddie!

108
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:39,005
Did you hear...
