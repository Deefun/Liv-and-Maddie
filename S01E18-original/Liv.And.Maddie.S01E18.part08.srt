162
00:08:11,719 --> 00:08:13,687
I didn't open Maddie's letter,

163
00:08:13,721 --> 00:08:16,756
but I struggled for hours about what to do with it.

164
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:20,026
In the end, I decided there really only was one right thing to do.

165
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:23,163
Hide it long enough for her to miss tryouts.

166
00:08:23,197 --> 00:08:27,701
Yeah, it turns out that the toilet tank is not a great hiding place.

167
00:08:31,072 --> 00:08:34,007
Mm, and...

168
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:35,141
There.

169
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,943
Oh, hair dryer.

170
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:39,045
Is there any problem you can't solve?

171
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,018
f-y-information, life is going to get a lot more complicated

172
00:08:45,052 --> 00:08:46,987
for you both when you grow up.

173
00:08:47,021 --> 00:08:48,855
(Knocking at door)

174
00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:50,156
Karen: Liv, honey, can I come in?

175
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:53,193
Uh...

176
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:56,930
(Murmuring)

177
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:04,037
Okay, yeah. Come on in.

178
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:06,973
Hey.

179
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:08,808
How are you doing?

180
00:09:08,843 --> 00:09:10,844
Oh! So good. I am phenomenal.

181
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:12,746
I am just great.

182
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,913
(Loud thuds)

183
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:18,752
(Sighs) Poor Maddie has been out on that basketball court all night.

184
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:21,154
She is so anxious waiting for this letter to arrive.

185
00:09:21,188 --> 00:09:23,790
It's just cruel that they make her wait so long.

186
00:09:23,824 --> 00:09:25,892
It is so cruel.

187
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,861
(Louder thuds)

188
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:30,964
(Sighs)

189
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:35,769
I have just been a nervous wreck thinking about another one of my babies

190
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:36,870
leaving the nest.

191
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:38,772
But you, you're right there.

192
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:40,106
Supporting your sister.

193
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,709
It's just like this picture you two made.

194
00:09:42,743 --> 00:09:45,745
"Sisters by chance, friends by choice."

195
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,982
You know... you girls live that every day.

196
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,850
Every day?

197
00:09:50,885 --> 00:09:54,020
Ha ha! Twice on Sundays.

198
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:58,191
Oh, I remember the night you were leaving for Hollywood.

199
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:07,033
(Sighing)

200
00:10:07,068 --> 00:10:09,102
Mom, mom, guess what.

201
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:10,770
What is it, Maddie?

202
00:10:10,805 --> 00:10:14,074
We played basketball at recess today and I was better than everyone.

203
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:15,875
Even the boys. Bam!

204
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,943
- What? - Bam!

205
00:10:16,977 --> 00:10:18,945
What?

206
00:10:18,979 --> 00:10:20,980
Ooh, I like that.

207
00:10:21,015 --> 00:10:22,115
Bam! What?!

208
00:10:29,023 --> 00:10:31,891
What is happening?

209
00:10:31,926 --> 00:10:35,061
Joey, Parker just follows you around

210
00:10:35,096 --> 00:10:36,963
because he worships the ground you walk on.

211
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:39,132
It is cute that he can't take his eyes off of you.

212
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:42,936
So that's why he poops with the door open.

213
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,805
He'll grow out of that.

214
00:10:48,042 --> 00:10:49,209
Appreciate the offer.

215
00:10:49,243 --> 00:10:50,810
What offer?

216
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:54,814
Bluetoothin', babe gotta bail, brah.

217
00:10:54,849 --> 00:10:59,219
Okay, here's aunt Dina's number in case you need to get ahold of us in L.A.

218
00:10:59,253 --> 00:11:00,820
Keep it someplace safe.

219
00:11:00,855 --> 00:11:03,123
Got it.

220
00:11:03,157 --> 00:11:05,992
There she is. Look out, Hollywood.

221
00:11:06,026 --> 00:11:09,129
It is Liv Rooney.

222
00:11:09,163 --> 00:11:11,831
I had the most amaze-a-licious idea.

223
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:15,168
Instead of saying the name of my show, I should always sing it.

224
00:11:15,202 --> 00:11:18,104
Sing it loud!

225
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,842
That's gonna get old.

226
00:11:22,877 --> 00:11:24,744
Gonna?

227
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,112
All right, everybody.

228
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,748
Time to take mom and Liv to the airport.

229
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:31,785
Wait. I need a twin moment.

230
00:11:31,819 --> 00:11:32,886
Are they gonna hug or fight?

231
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,754
I never know.

232
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,791
Look, I could be gone for a long time.

233
00:11:37,825 --> 00:11:39,759
You say the word and I won't leave.

234
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:40,994
You have to go, Liv.

235
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:42,829
I'm going to miss you.

236
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:44,164
But this is your dream.

237
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,935
Thanks. That means everything to me.

238
00:11:48,969 --> 00:11:52,939
Now go out and show Hollywood how we do it in Stevens Point.

239
00:11:52,973 --> 00:11:55,842
Bam! What?!

240
00:11:55,876 --> 00:11:57,877
Yeah, don't do that.

241
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:00,814
(Both chuckle)

242
00:12:03,017 --> 00:12:04,751
Wow. (Laughs)

243
00:12:04,785 --> 00:12:06,085
Thank you, mom.

244
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,955
Really needed that reminder of how selfless my sister was.

245
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:12,058
I would be a monster not to do the same thing for her.

246
00:12:12,092 --> 00:12:14,894
Oh, a hideous monster.
