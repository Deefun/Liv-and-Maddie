131
00:05:46,207 --> 00:05:48,008
Dude, what are you wearing?

132
00:05:49,243 --> 00:05:51,778
We are not following Joey into the jungle.

133
00:05:51,813 --> 00:05:53,914
You don't know that.

134
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:58,819
So Maddie might move away and now you're dressed like a shrub.

135
00:06:00,788 --> 00:06:03,223
I got big problems, kid.

136
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,926
Leave them at the door.

137
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,727
We have work to do.

138
00:06:07,762 --> 00:06:11,731
I installed a GPS tracking app on Joey's cell phone...

139
00:06:11,766 --> 00:06:13,900
Would you believe his password was "1234"?

140
00:06:13,935 --> 00:06:15,101
What a munch.

141
00:06:15,136 --> 00:06:18,138
Total munch.

142
00:06:18,172 --> 00:06:22,776
Hey, can you teach me how to change the password on my phone?
