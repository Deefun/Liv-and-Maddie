152
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:50,634
好了  开始吧
Okay, here we go.
 
153
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:56,306
这只不过是个冰棒而已嘛
Okay, this is just frozen mustard.
 
154
00:07:58,209 --> 00:07:59,576
但是是从哪里进口的
But from where?
 
155
00:08:03,314 --> 00:08:07,117
是在法国制作的黄色第戎雪糕
A light yellow dijon originally crafted in France
 
156
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:11,288
但是加工地在肯塔基州
but now manufactured in Kentucky...
 
157
00:08:11,322 --> 00:08:12,289
浸泡加工了一次
Dipped once...
 
158
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,490
不对
no.
 
159
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,460
是两次
Twice!
 
160
00:08:17,495 --> 00:08:19,496
浸泡在热狗味的水里
In hot dog water.
 
161
00:08:21,532 --> 00:08:22,499
啊
Ah.
 
162
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,534
太激动人心了
Inspiring.

164
00:08:26,337 --> 00:08:28,505
獠牙来了  獠牙来了
Fangs is here! Fangs is here.
 
165
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:30,207
噢  是那本书里的女孩么
Ooh, the girl from the book?
 
166
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:32,142
对  你们猜准了
Yeah. You guys were right.
 
167
00:08:32,176 --> 00:08:34,544
我意识到如果我要获得主演资格的话  就必须放手一搏
I've realized that if I want this part I have to do something really big,
 
168
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:39,282
所以我聘请了獠牙来引导我演出真正的狼性
so I hired fangs to help me tap into my inner wolf.
 
169
00:08:40,518 --> 00:08:42,152
丽芙·鲁尼  你的快递
Delivery for Liv Rooney?
 
170
00:08:42,186 --> 00:08:44,187
- 在这里签收  - 好的
- Sign here. - Okay.
 
171
00:08:44,222 --> 00:08:46,156
哦
Oh.
 
172
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,625
这是什么  是不是獠牙把她的行李都提前运过来了
That's so weird. Maybe fangs had all her bags shipped here?

175
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,335
这是獠牙吗
Is that fangs?
 
176
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:01,471
不对  哥们  这是另外一个给狼养大的姑娘吧
No, munch, it's a different girl who was raised by wolves.
 
177
00:09:03,207 --> 00:09:05,342
獠牙你好啊
Hello, fangs!
 
178
00:09:05,376 --> 00:09:06,476
我是丽芙啊
Me Liv!

180
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:11,448
我在她的书里学到这招的
I read this in her book.
 
181
00:09:11,482 --> 00:09:13,383
她必须要熟悉一下陌生人的气味
She has to get used to the smell of new people.
 
182
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:17,454
你的气味我能接受
Your scent is acceptable.

184
00:09:22,326 --> 00:09:24,294
抱歉运来了个笼子
Sorry about the cage.
 
185
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:28,531
我的狼性太强了  我怕我在陌生人面前控制不住自己
My wolf instincts are strong, and I don't trust myself around new humans.
 
186
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,203
再说了  把我当货物运更便宜
Plus, it's cheaper to travel in cargo.
 
187
00:09:35,406 --> 00:09:37,307
那好  獠牙  这是我的弟弟们
Well, fangs, these are my brothers.
 
191
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,319
不骗你  我还真习惯了
Not gonna lie, I'm into this.
 
192
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,158
很高兴你的来电  鲁尼
Glad you called, Rooney.
 
193
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:57,160
我不会错过任何一个能保证狼
I never miss a chance to make sure wolves
 
194
00:09:57,194 --> 00:10:00,163
在传媒上大放光彩的机会
are accurately portrayed in the media.
 
195
00:10:00,197 --> 00:10:03,500
那好吧  如果别人问到了  我就会很骄傲的说
Well, then, if anyone asks, I will proudly state for the record
 
196
00:10:03,534 --> 00:10:07,170
你没有吃我的奶奶或是把房子炸了什么的
that you did not eat my grandma or blow my house down.
 
197
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:08,338
看见了吧  刚才那叫
See, that right there?
 
198
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:09,339
无礼攻击
Offensive.
 
199
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:13,176
我们开始吧
Let's begin.
 
200
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:15,245
特里斯坦·莱肯是狼人  半身是狼
Tristan Lycanth is half-wolf.
 
201
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,549
狼是庄严而又凶猛的生物
Wolves are majestic, fierce creatures.
 
202
00:10:19,583 --> 00:10:21,251
你身上有这些特性吗  鲁尼
You got any wolf in you, Rooney?
 
203
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:24,287
呃  不  她没有
Um, no. No, she does not.
 
204
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,489
丽芙  她闻过了我的胳肢窝
Liv she sniffed my pits.
 
205
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,491
我可不敢忽悠她
I can't lie to her.
 
206
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,360
嚎叫一声听听
Howl for me.
 
207
00:10:30,394 --> 00:10:32,529
这是成为一只狼最重要的部分
It's the most important part about being a wolf.
 
208
00:10:32,563 --> 00:10:34,564
这宣示了你的尊严
It asserts your dominance.
 
209
00:10:34,598 --> 00:10:38,568
我的嚎叫声是有尊严又花哨的
Well, my howl is dom-alicious.
 
212
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:53,283
鲁尼  我们的工作量不小啊
Rooney, we have work to do.
 
213
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:54,517
什么
What?
 
214
00:10:54,552 --> 00:10:57,654
你要学会向狼一样生活  捕猎  进食
You're gonna live like a wolf, hunt like a wolf, eat like a wolf
 
215
00:10:57,688 --> 00:10:59,622
甚至要向狼一样大便
and poop like a wolf.
 
216
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,158
噢  我可以给她演示最后一种
Oh, I can show her the last one.
 
217
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:10,333
没错  我可以模仿 84 种动物大便的方式
Yeah, I can imitate the pooping styles of 84 different animal species.
 
218
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:14,170
非常感谢你提供的便便样本  小子
Your offer of a poop demo is appreciated, little man.
 
219
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:16,239
但是丽芙现在是我的学生了
But Liv's my student now.
 
220
00:11:16,273 --> 00:11:18,408
欢迎进入狼的生活
Welcome to my wolf pack.

222
00:11:20,511 --> 00:11:23,446
这简直太酷了
This is gonna be so awesome.
