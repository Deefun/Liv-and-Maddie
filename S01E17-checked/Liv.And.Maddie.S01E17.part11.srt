375
00:18:24,424 --> 00:18:26,625
你们两个小棉花糖一踏上跳舞毯
When you two marshmallows first stepped up to the mat,

376
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,461
我就知道霹雳舞就是你们的需要的火
I was like "breakdancing is gonna roast them alive."

378
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:33,566
我也尽了严师的责任了
But I've been spitting a little knowledge to you two,

379
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,867
而你们也算是朽木可雕
and you all have soaked it up.

380
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:44,577
舞王玛蒂来了
Mix master Maddie in the house!

381
00:18:44,611 --> 00:18:46,545
哦
Joey: Yeah.

382
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,780
玛蒂  你来干嘛
Maddie, what are you doing here?

383
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,848
迪吉  我意识到
Diggie, I realized that...

384
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:51,5845
所谓情侣
Being a part of a couple

385
00:18:51,618 --> 00:18:53,652
有时就需要爱屋及乌
means sometimes doing things that the other person likes.

386
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:57,556
所以  我和 Q 舞帝会过，他教了我一些舞步
So I met up with q-pop earlier, and he taught me a couple moves.

387
00:18:58,825 --> 00:19:01,694
我觉着吧  不成功便成仁
I figure if I can't beat 'em, break 'em.

388
00:19:01,728 --> 00:19:04,730
成仁不成那就来跳舞吧
Oh, and if you can't break 'em, breakdance.

390
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:13,806
说真的  玛蒂  霹雳舞可是 J 舞者和 D 大哥的菜  喔
Seriously, Maddie, breakdancing is mc j-town and dig-dog's thing... whoa!

392
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:16,408
来吧  Q 舞帝
Cue it, pop.

393
00:19:16,443 --> 00:19:17,743
喔  就是这样
Oh, that's how I do!

395
00:19:41,768 --> 00:19:43,736
就是这样
And that is how I do.

396
00:19:46,606 --> 00:19:47,740
哇  好吧  乔伊  走起
Yeah, okay. Beat it, Joey.

398
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:55,848
我是说那个走起
The other "beat it."

399
00:19:55,882 --> 00:19:57,416
知道啦
I know.
