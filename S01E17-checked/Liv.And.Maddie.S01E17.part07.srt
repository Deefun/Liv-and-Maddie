223
00:11:28,342 --> 00:11:30,443
如果你需要上厕所  只要出门直走就可以
And if you need the restroom, it's just back that way.
 
224
00:11:30,477 --> 00:11:31,611
得了吧
Nah.
 
225
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:34,447
在我进来之前就在你们走廊上留了领地标记了
Marked my territory on your porch before I came in.
 
226
00:11:35,482 --> 00:11:37,317
噢  身上好痒
Ooh, got an itch.
 
227
00:11:37,351 --> 00:11:38,585
挠不到  挠不到
Can't get it. Can't get it.

228
00:11:38,619 --> 00:11:39,586
- 挠不到  - 好吧
- Can't get it. - Okay.
 
229
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,421
帮帮同类啊
Help a wolf out!
 
230
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:42,655
噢
Oh!

232
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:46,593
啊  这就舒服多了
Ahh, that's the stuff.
 
233
00:11:46,627 --> 00:11:48,328
是吗
Yeah?
 
234
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:50,663
这狼孩简直疯了
Wolf girl is cray cray.
 
235
00:11:50,698 --> 00:11:53,433
不过我还需要她训练我身上那种丛林山野的气息
But she is going to give me the forest cred
 
236
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:54,801
我才能通过这次试镜
that I need to really nail this audition.
 
237
00:11:54,835 --> 00:11:58,404
有本事你就把那从马路上拖下来吃了啊  戈斯林
Scrape that off the road and eat it, Gosling.
 
238
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:02,642
这些是从把我养大的狼家里带出来的东西
This is from the forest where my wolf family raised me.
 
239
00:12:02,676 --> 00:12:05,578
这些东西的的味道都不太好闻
Lots of good stink to roll around in.
 
240
00:12:05,613 --> 00:12:06,579
哦
Oh!
 
241
00:12:09,316 --> 00:12:10,550
啊
Ah.

243
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,657
舒服啊
Ahh.
 
244
00:12:19,727 --> 00:12:21,527
到你了  小狼崽子
Your turn, wolf pup.
 
245
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:23,329
去打打滚吧
Get up in it.
 
246
00:12:23,364 --> 00:12:24,497
好吧
Okay.

248
00:12:27,501 --> 00:12:29,469
呼
Whoo.
 
249
00:12:29,503 --> 00:12:31,638
看看我
Look at me.
 
250
00:12:31,672 --> 00:12:35,308
在一堆脏兮兮的东西上蹭来蹭去
Scooting around in the filth.
 
251
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:36,576
呼
Whoo.
 
252
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:37,644
就像是动物一样
Like an animal.
 
253
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:39,312
我真是野性十足啊
I am wild!
 
254
00:12:41,348 --> 00:12:43,316
- 鲁尼  - 怎么了
- Rooney... - Yeah?
 
255
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,684
- 我就把话直说了吧  - 嗯哼
- Can I get real for a minute? - Mm-hmm?
 
256
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:48,554
如果你想在试镜中脱颖而出  你就要像真狼一样
If you want to ace this audition, you have to go full wolf.
 
257
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:50,490
狼是领地意识很强的动物
Wolves are territorial animals.
 
258
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,557
- 好的  - 它们拿走了的东西
- Yeah. - They take what's theirs,
 
259
00:12:51,592 --> 00:12:53,593
- 就永远别想拿回来了  - 好吧
- and they don't back down. - Yeah.
 
260
00:12:53,627 --> 00:12:54,761
我们来试试别的吧
Let's try something else.
 
261
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,529
干嘛呢
What?
 
262
00:12:58,532 --> 00:12:59,565
你想拿回去么
You want it?
 
263
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,533
来抢啊
Take it.
 
264
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,369
好吧
Okay.

269
00:13:23,457 --> 00:13:25,291
我这就去拿水枪
I'm gonna go get the hose.
