121
00:05:46,377 --> 00:05:47,511
哇
Whoa.
 
122
00:05:56,554 --> 00:05:59,189
刚才的舞蹈太酷了  Q 舞帝
That was awesome, qpop.
 
123
00:05:59,223 --> 00:06:02,159
对  我从来不会停下脚步
Yeah, q-pop don't stop.
 
124
00:06:02,193 --> 00:06:03,393
噢
Oh.

126
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:18,141
J 舞者要驾到了哟
Mc j-town in da house.
 
127
00:06:20,545 --> 00:06:23,480
J 舞者真有个性
Mc j-town be his own boy.
 
128
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:24,481
致敬
Respect!
 
129
00:06:28,352 --> 00:06:29,386
乔伊  这是 Q 舞帝
Joey, this is q-pop.
 
130
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,487
他是我们的舞蹈教练
He's our dance instructor.
 
131
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:33,190
噢  那好  很高兴见到你  舞帝先生
Oh, well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. pop.
 
132
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:37,327
我的使命就是跟随新潮  保持新潮  还要不断刷新潮流
My mission is to get fresh, stay fresh, then refresh.
 
133
00:06:40,364 --> 00:06:42,566
这就是我的座右铭  托付给你们这犄角旮旯了
I just dropped my motto on this grotto.
 
135
00:06:44,402 --> 00:06:46,269
这真是酷毙了
This is so cool.
 
136
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:47,504
我不敢相信玛蒂不在这儿
I can't believe Maddie bailed.
 
137
00:06:47,538 --> 00:06:48,638
我简直无拘无束了
I feel so alive.
 
138
00:06:50,374 --> 00:06:53,477
她失去的正是霹雳舞好哥们得到的
Her loss is the breaking bros' gain.
 
139
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,345
再说了  谁知道我住在这么一个犄角旮旯呢
Plus, who knew I lived in a grotto.
 
140
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,546
对吗
Right?
 
141
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,216
各就各位  让我来看看你们练得咋样了
All right. Let's see what y'all are working with.
 
142
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,250
来引领潮流吧  呀哈
Time to get fresh, y'all.
 
143
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:04,254
当我开始放节奏  我就要看你们跳机器人舞
When I drop the beat, I want to see you robot.

145
00:07:09,594 --> 00:07:12,562
哦  不
Oh... no.
 
146
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:20,270
同志们  你们是故意要气哭我吗
Gentlemen, are y'all trying to make q-pop cry?
 
147
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,309
好了  我们现在退回到几个简单的动作  明白了吗
All right, let's try to back it up to a simpler move, okay?
 
148
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,146
这个动作叫“找准节奏”
This one is called "finding the beat!"

150
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,625
等一下  慢点来
Okay, wait. Slow down.
 
151
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,461
你们到底是怎么打响指的啊
How are you making that noise with your fingers?
