293
00:14:36,463 --> 00:14:39,298
今早的训练太棒了  獠牙
Great training sesh this morning, fangs.
 
294
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,334
赶鸭子实在是太好玩了
It was so much fun chasing ducks.
 
295
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,302
可不是嘛
Tell me about it.
 
296
00:14:43,337 --> 00:14:45,471
它们真是身在福中不知福
They've had it too good for too long.
 
297
00:14:46,774 --> 00:14:48,474
我觉得午餐有肉下肚了
I think we've earned lunch.

299
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:01,621
怎么在地板上吃东西
Eating off the floor.
 
300
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:04,557
你们是给狼养大的么
Were you raised by wolves?
 
301
00:15:04,591 --> 00:15:06,392
妈
Mom.
 
302
00:15:06,426 --> 00:15:07,560
噢  抱歉抱歉
Oh, sorry sorry.
 
303
00:15:07,594 --> 00:15:09,562
真是太对不起了
Sorry sorry sorry.
 
304
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,269
獠牙  你能这么辛苦地训练我真是谢谢了
Thanks for training with me so hard this week, fangs.
 
305
00:15:16,303 --> 00:15:18,437
我这次试镜胜券在握了
I am going to nail this audition.
 
306
00:15:18,472 --> 00:15:20,573
我拿定了这个角色  对不对
That part is so mine, am I right?

308
00:15:25,646 --> 00:15:28,381
当一只狼很安静  就说明它不同意我的看法
When the wolf is silent, the wolf disapproves.
 
309
00:15:28,415 --> 00:15:29,382
到底怎么了
What's wrong?
 
310
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:34,387
就你现在的表现而言  唯一能搞定试镜的方式
As good as you're doing, the only way you're gonna nail that audition
 
311
00:15:34,421 --> 00:15:36,389
就是搞定你的嚎叫声
is if you nail your howl.
 
312
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,391
这是每一只狼的内心和灵魂所在
It is the heart and soul of any wolf.

314
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,331
呃  我
Wow, I...
 
315
00:15:45,365 --> 00:15:48,501
觉得你好像吓着所有邻居家的狗狗了
Think you scared every dog in the neighborhood.
 
316
00:15:48,535 --> 00:15:49,635
不
No.
 
317
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,572
隔壁街区有只杜宾狗没回复我
There's a doberman on the next block who didn't reply.
 
320
00:15:56,643 --> 00:15:58,744
这下他回复了
There he is.
 
321
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:00,379
他是在道歉
He apologized.
 
322
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:03,316
你总不能一边撒尿一边嚎叫吧
You can't pee and bark at the same time.
 
323
00:16:04,451 --> 00:16:05,585
好了  鲁尼  到你了
Okay, Rooney. Your turn.
 
324
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:06,686
好的
Okay.

327
00:16:11,291 --> 00:16:13,593
(曲调是福音歌曲《奇异恩典》)
 
328
00:16:18,298 --> 00:16:20,266
别再不务正业了
Quit goofing around.
 
329
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,435
你嚎叫的时候一点都不认真
You're not taking your howl seriously.
 
330
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,337
跟你说吧
You know what?
 
331
00:16:24,371 --> 00:16:25,371
我不干了
I'm out.
 
332
00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:26,606
什么
What?
 
333
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,442
你不能不干啊  我们是一伙的
You can't be out. We're in a pack.
 
334
00:16:29,476 --> 00:16:31,344
你还舔过我的脸呢
You licked my face.
 
335
00:16:32,646 --> 00:16:33,679
抱歉了  鲁尼
I'm sorry, Rooney.
 
336
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:35,448
我们已经尽力了
We've gone as far as we can go.
 
337
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:39,518
还有就是我总痒痒  但你妈不给我在你们家地毯上挠屁股
Plus, I'm itchy and your mom won't let me drag my butt on your carpet.
 
338
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:43,289
你猜怎么着 好吧
You know what? Fine.
 
339
00:16:43,323 --> 00:16:46,459
我会在没有你的帮助的情况下  成为一个了不起的特里斯坦的
I am going to be an awesome Tristan without your help.
 
340
00:16:46,493 --> 00:16:48,294
哦  你想吃这块肉么
Oh, you want this?
 
341
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:49,462
唔  很好
Mmm. Yeah?
 
342
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:50,630
我知道你早就垂涎三尺了
Yeah, I know you want it.
 
343
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,498
香喷喷的  对不
Yum yum, right?
 
344
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:53,633
快去拿吧
Go get it!

346
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:03,409
真是只笨狼啊
Stupid wolf.
