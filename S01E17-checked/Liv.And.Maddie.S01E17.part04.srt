89
00:04:03,308 --> 00:04:05,242
准备好了吗
Ready?
 
90
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:19,556
黑面包  桔子酱  花菜浓浆  上等的大腊肠
Rye bread, marmalade, pureed cauliflower, the good bologna
 
91
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:24,194
还有一丁点脚趾甲
and just a hint of toenail.
 
92
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,397
左脚大拇指上的
Left foot, big toe.
 
94
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:30,534
完全正确
Nailed it.
 
95
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:34,571
小伙子们  你们也知道我对《太空狼人》
Okay. So boys, you got me a little bit nervous
 
96
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:36,506
的试镜环节有一点紧张
about my "space werewolves" audition,
 
97
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,509
所以我决定通过这个来体验狼人生活
so I decided to get my wolf on with this:
 
98
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:43,180
艾米·“獠牙”·沃尔夫特撰写的《狼人之道》
"The Way of the Wolf" by Emmy "Fangs" Wulfert.
（艾米·沃尔夫特是本剧主演两个替身的姓名混合体） 

99
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:45,615
“獠牙”是一个青少年的狼人女孩
"Fangs" is a teenage wolf girl.
 
100
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,551
当她很小的时候  她在一次露营中走散了
When she was little, she wandered off on a camping trip
 
101
00:04:47,585 --> 00:04:52,189
之后十年就都在丛林中度过  被一群狼养大了
and spent the next 10 years of her life in the wild being raised by wolves.

103
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,193
我还在想玛蒂是不是就这么变成现在这样了
I wonder if that's how Maddie became Maddie.

105
00:04:57,462 --> 00:04:59,363
她喜欢狼  不敢相信
She likes wolves. Big whoop.
 
106
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:04,267
我听说范·迪塞尔梦寐以求那个角色  甚至做手术种植了狼的獠牙
I heard diesel wants the part so bad, he had wolf fangs surgically implanted.
 
107
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:06,136
什么
What?
 
108
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:11,308
而过去整整两个月  戈斯林都在吃公路上被撞死的动物为生
And for the past two months, Gosling's been eating nothing but roadkill.

110
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,543
他们肯定会击败我的
They're gonna crush me.
 
111
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,379
我需要你们的帮助
Okay, I need your help.
 
112
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:17,481
我怎么摸透特里斯坦啊  他最喜欢什么
How do I figure out Tristan? What's his thing?
 
113
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:20,183
不用想就知道  当然是他的嚎叫啊
No brainer. It's his howl.
 
114
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:21,485
好的  我来试试
Okay, yeah. I got this.

117
00:05:30,428 --> 00:05:33,330
听起来五成像狼  五成像丽芙
It's like 50% wolf, 50% Liv.
 
118
00:05:34,465 --> 00:05:35,599
你们觉得怎么样啊
What do you guys think?
 
119
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:37,634
- 选迪塞尔吧  - 选戈斯林
- Diesel. - Gosling.
