401
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:03,422
好
Okay.

402
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:08,494
准备来一个狼人的嚎叫吧  很关键哦
Get ready for a howl that is going to change your life.

403
00:20:08,528 --> 00:20:09,795
好咧  准备好了
(Chuckles) Okay, get ready.

404
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:13,599
来了哦
It's coming. (Clears throat)

405
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,633
你知道的
Although, you know...

406
00:20:16,636 --> 00:20:19,605
刚刚想了想
Just sort of like off the top of my head,

407
00:20:19,639 --> 00:20:23,442
少点吼叫多点清脆怎么样
what if it was sort of less of a howl and more of a whistle?

408
00:20:23,476 --> 00:20:25,444
嗯  嗯
Yeah, yeah.

409
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:26,779
我是说，观众完全
'Cause I mean, the audience totally...

410
00:20:26,813 --> 00:20:27,880
嚎叫
just howl!

411
00:20:29,816 --> 00:20:30,783
明白
Got it.

413
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:40,693
我叫“獠牙”·沃尔夫特  我是来这儿为的角色试镜的
My name is fangs wolfert, and I'm here to try out for the part of Tristan.

415
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:45,831
你在干嘛
What are you doing?

417
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,569
给我一分钟时间和我的狼人教练私聊一会儿
Just give me one second to talk to my wolf coach real quick.

418
00:20:50,603 --> 00:20:51,570
给我出去
Get out.

419
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,474
狼人想干就干
A wolf takes what it wants.

420
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:56,809
我要拿下这个角色
And I'm taking this part.

421
00:20:56,843 --> 00:20:57,910
噢
Oh.

422
00:20:57,944 --> 00:21:01,613
我们可是在舞台上哦  獠牙
We are on a soundstage right now, fangs.

423
00:21:01,648 --> 00:21:04,416
我的底盘
This is my territory.

424
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:05,851
此言差矣
Doesn't look like it.

427
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,522
我是特里斯坦莱肯
I am Tristan Lycanth.

428
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:14,460
不  我才是特里斯坦莱肯
No, I am Tristan Lycanth.

431
00:21:23,803 --> 00:21:25,604
结束
And scene.

432
00:21:27,474 --> 00:21:29,441
哇哦
Wow.

433
00:21:29,476 --> 00:21:31,543
我们讨论一下然后回来
Let us discuss and we'll get back to you.

434
00:21:31,578 --> 00:21:33,612
查查是谁帮她做的头发
Find out who styles the brunette's hair.

435
00:21:33,646 --> 00:21:34,613
简直是超爱
I love it.

436
00:21:36,516 --> 00:21:37,916
獠牙
Fangs!

437
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:40,786
这都是我的计划
All part of my plan.

439
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:44,456
哦哦
Oh-ho...

440
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:45,924
真不赖
You are good.

441
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,563
我知道只要我向你挑战  咱们所有的努力都会有回报的
I knew that if I threatened your territory, all our hard work would pay off

442
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:52,865
而你的狼人本性就会显露无疑
and your inner wolf would emerge.

443
00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:55,567
虽然不知道我有没有胜过莱恩·戈斯林和莱恩·戈斯林
Well, I don't know if I'd beat Gosling or diesel,

444
00:21:55,602 --> 00:21:58,637
但是  我做到了獠牙  我吼出来了
but I did it, fangs. I howled.

445
00:21:58,671 --> 00:21:59,805
是的
I heard.

446
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:01,874
听起来像我妈妈
It sounded like my mother.
