485
00:22:06,858 --> 00:22:08,592
我不得不佩服你 哥们
I got to hand it to you, munch.
 
486
00:22:08,594 --> 00:22:10,528
你想出来了个疯狂的主意
You came up with a ridiculous idea
 
487
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,596
而且让它还奏效了
And you made it work.
 
488
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,533
最好的是压根没人发现
The best part is nobody found out.
 
489
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:21,405
你们俩干的事被我发现了
You two are so busted.
 
490
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,874
太对不住了  我们本该
We're sorry. we should--
 
491
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:28,379
你到底知道了些什么
What do you know?
 
492
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:32,016
噢  你们直接侵犯了我的地盘
Oh, just that you completely space-invaded me.
 
493
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,019
如果你们要拿我最爱的梳子
If you are going to use my favorite hairbrush
 
494
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,954
去梳小丑的假发
To brush out a clown wig,
 
495
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:39,190
至少要刷完后把恶心的橙色头发
At least remove the nasty orange hair
 
496
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,158
都清除掉
When you're done.
 
497
00:22:42,994 --> 00:22:45,162
对的 被你发现了
Yeah, you got us.
 
498
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,431
我们确实偷了你的梳子去梳小丑的假发套
We were stealing brushes and combing clown wigs
 
499
00:22:47,433 --> 00:22:49,934
梳了一整个周末
All weekend.
 
500
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,336
真是火眼金睛啊
Totally busted.
 
501
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,504
千万别在这么干了
Just don't let it happen again.
 
502
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,679
给你 20 美元  帮我把那梳子弄到手
I'll give you 20 bucks if you can get me that brush.
