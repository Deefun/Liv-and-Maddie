00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,142
一个新包包
A new bag?
 
4
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,112
还是那种短到都拉不过腰的性感内衣
Underwear that doesn't go all the way up to your waist?
 
5
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:16,615
这是个古董级的搓衣板
It is an antique washboard.
 
6
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:19,251
哦  真是个漂亮的玩意啊
Oh! isn't she a beaut?
 
7
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,587
它将会帮助
It's going to help

11
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,728
和玛蒂去郊游的那个
That Maddie and I used to go to on field trips
 
12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,996
最大的特色在于上厕所的时候
Where the highlight was going to the bathroom
 
13
00:00:30,998 --> 00:00:32,998
要坐在圆木上的深山老林么
While sitting on a log?
 
14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,968
对头  玛蒂和我已经连续四年

参加这个挑战赛了
For the last four years.
 
16
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,838
你只要在树林中搭帐篷
You camp in the woods
 
17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,307
体验着和十九世纪先人们一样的生活
And live like people did in the 1800s.
 
18
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,643
你这是造了什么孽啊
Are you being punished?

并且在其他的女同胞面前耀武扬威
And gets to lord it over the other ladies
 
22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,652
整整一年
For the entire year.
 
23
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:55,154
只不过现在金搅子还是一幅照片
Yeah, this is just a picture
 
24
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:56,622
因为我和我妈并没赢过
'cause mom and I have never really won it.
 
25
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:58,290
对啊  我们中总有一个在拿够胜利点之前
Well, one of us always seems to get leprosy
 
26
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,658
被裁定为得了麻风病
Or fall into a wolverine nest
 
27
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,093
- 或是掉到了狼窝里头  - 对的
- before we get enough points. - yeah.
 
28
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:03,595
我们中的一个  指的是玛蒂
And by one of us, I mean maddie.
 
29
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:05,164
- 妈  - 怎么了
- mom. - hmm?
 
30
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,999
我可以看得到听得到你
I can see and hear you.
 
31
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:08,267
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.
 
32
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,869
呃  这不会是你又要拖着我去的
Ugh! this isn't going to be one of those things
 
33
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,071
那一堆破事吧
That you drag me to, is it?

36
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:19,945
我们笑个啥呢
Why are we laughing?
 
37
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,180
我跟着你去有什么好笑的
What's so funny about me going with you?
 
38
00:01:21,182 --> 00:01:22,681
你到底要不要邀请我
Are you inviting me or not?
 
39
00:01:22,683 --> 00:01:26,652
丽芙  这是脏兮兮苦哈哈的野外生存
Liv, this is rough-and-tumble outdoorsy living.
 
40
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,353
我们当然不会邀请你了
Of course we're not inviting you.
 
41
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:31,290
她胆敢不邀请我
How dare she not invite me.
 
42
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,725
当然了  这活动听起来
Sure, it sounds gross
 
43
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:34,927
又恶心又脏兮兮的又愚蠢
And dirty and stupid,
 
44
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,328
但是她好歹要问问我啊
But she should have at least asked.
 
45
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,362
这样我就可以严词拒绝
Then I could have turned her down
 
46
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,931
并且嘲笑她了
And laughed in her face.
 
47
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,699
算了吧  你一天都撑不过去的
No, you wouldn't survive a day.
