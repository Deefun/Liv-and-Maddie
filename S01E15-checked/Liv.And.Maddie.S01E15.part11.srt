345
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:56,921
哦  谢谢帮忙挑水  丽芙
Oh, thanks for fetching the water, liv.
 
346
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:59,691
你错过了一个美好的早晨
You missed a wonderful wake.

348
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:04,529
好了  现在玛蒂那组已经出局了
Yeah, and now with Maddie out of the game,
 
349
00:16:04,531 --> 00:16:07,231
我们也许真的有击败妈妈的好机会
We might actually have a chance at beating mom.
 
350
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,100
她没必要把所有的柴禾都
She did have to trade in all her firewood
 
351
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,802
换成葬花啊
For funeral flowers.
 
352
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,571
噢  布丽
Oh, bree.
 
353
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:15,006
我真为我们感到骄傲
I am so proud of us.
 
354
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,108
我是说  一开始  我们无中生有
I mean, first, we create butter out of nothing
 
355
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,044
就制成了奶油
But thin air.
 
356
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,580
呃  好吧  五加仑的牛奶和三小时的苦工
Okay, well, five gallons of milk and three hours of labor,
 
357
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,916
但是仍然  我们制成了奶油
But still-- we made butter.
 
358
00:16:24,918 --> 00:16:28,619
而现在我们要把衣服弄得
And now we are getting our clothes
 
359
00:16:28,621 --> 00:16:31,622
一尘不染
Squeaky clean...
 
360
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:35,259
而不花分毫
With nothing...
 
361
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:37,228
除了脏石头
But dirty rocks...
 
362
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,064
和把我皮肤伤得不浅的肥皂
And soap that I'm pretty sure is burning my skin off.
 
363
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:43,267
让我自己这么说吧
And if I do say so myself,
 
364
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,570
我弄了把有老妈架子的
I have dropped a butt bomb
 
365
00:16:45,572 --> 00:16:47,505
原木梳子
Of pioneer mom on this here log comb.
 
366
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,608
哎呀
Ow!
 
367
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,043
哎呀
Ow!
 
368
00:16:52,045 --> 00:16:53,778
哎呀
Ow!
 
369
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,281
我其实休息了一小会
I actually took a little break
 
370
00:16:57,283 --> 00:16:58,816
把我的脚丫子放到溪水里
And cooled my toes off in the stream,
 
371
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,785
然后提神到让我的脚像被刺了一样
And it was so refreshing that it made my feet tingle.
 
372
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,687
真是爽啊
You go, girl!
 
373
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,556
那是蚂蟥吗
Are those leeches?

375
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:09,027
蚂蟥  活生生的蚂蟥
Leeches! real, live leeches!
 
376
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,995
快把那些吸血鬼弄走啊
Get these bloodsucking slugs off of me!
 
377
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,663
布丽  别愣着不动
Bree, do something!
 
378
00:17:12,665 --> 00:17:14,132
快放开她  蚂蟥们
Get off her, leeches!
 
379
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:16,801
快走  快走
Shoo! shoo!
 
380
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:18,569
得了吧  布丽
Come on, bree.
 
381
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,671
这就是你该搭个老妈架子的地方
This is where you drop a butt bomb of mom on it.
 
382
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,774
哦  宝贝  我又不是你亲妈
Oh, honey, I'm not your mom.
 
383
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,542
别做傻事哦
Don't take this the wrong way.
 
384
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,877
我先走一步了
But I'm out of here.
 
385
00:17:25,879 --> 00:17:29,113
难道还有不傻的事可做吗
Is there a right way to take that?
