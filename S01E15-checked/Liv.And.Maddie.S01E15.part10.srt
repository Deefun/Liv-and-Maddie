306
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:06,544
之后丽芙的角色就说
And then Liv's character was like,
 
307
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,779
哦不  你可没这么干
"oh, no, you didn't!"
 
308
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:08,980
之后那个坏女孩就说
And then the bad girl was like,
 
309

哦是的  我就这么干了
"oh, yes, I did."
 
310
00:14:10,116 --> 00:14:12,717
之后她们怒气冲冲的来了一场舞蹈比赛
And then they had an angry dance-off.
 
311
00:14:12,719 --> 00:14:15,820
就像是
It was like-- 
 
312
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:17,922
亚蒂  亚蒂  亚蒂  亚蒂
Artie. artie. artie! artie!
 
313
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:19,424
你够了
That is enough.
 
314
00:14:19,426 --> 00:14:20,592
下床去
Get off the bed.
 
315
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,995
好吧
Fine.
 
316
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,364
之后她们化解恩怨  成了对好朋友
And then they made up and became best friends.

318
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,535
好了 同志们
All right, people.
 
319

请把注意力集中到窗台上
Please direct your attention to the window seat,
 
320
00:14:33,073 --> 00:14:34,939

我还要花钱买那些我送她的吗
Do I have to pay for the ones I gave her?
 
324
00:14:41,681 --> 00:14:44,549
你只要不把从她桌子底下
I'm not answering that question
 
325
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,050
抠来的口香糖吐出来
Until you've returned the gum
 
326
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,052
我就不回答你的提问
You took from under her desk.
 
327
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,430
嘿  孩子们  你们在楼上么
Hey, boys, you up there?
 
328
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,199
老爸来了  大家快躲起来
Dad's coming. everybody hide!
 
329

330
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,870

转移速度快点
And we're moving faster.
 
333
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:12,176
都赶快躲进去啊
So that means move faster.
 
334
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:18,149
嘿  你们俩在丽芙和玛蒂的房间里干嘛
Hey, what are you doing in Liv and maddie's room?
 
335
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,552
我们只是太想念她们了
We just miss them so much.
 
336
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,057
还有那堆阁楼里的毛绒玩具是怎么回事
And why are their stuffed animals down from the attic?
 
337

我们也太想念它们了
We missed them too.
 
338

那台垃圾粉碎机彻底坏了
Well, the garbage disposal's fried.
 
339
00:15:35,035 --> 00:15:37,602
我要去五金店买一台新的
I have to go to the hardware store to get a new one.
 
340
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:40,471
果然  你确实是铁血真男儿啊
Yeah, you're a real man's man.
 
341
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:42,540
我先离开一会儿
I'll see you later.
 
342
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,042
对了  帮我个忙
