237
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:26,625
这边走  妹子们
Right this way, ladies.
 
238
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:29,561
现在往左看  这次游览的重头戏
And now to our left, the highlight of the tour.
 
239
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:34,132
丽芙·鲁尼的闺房
Liv rooney's sleeping chamber.
 
240
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:37,502
请不要越过房间属于丽芙的那头
Please do not disturb liv's side of the room.
 
241
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:41,239
但是没啥名气的她双胞胎的床就随便站
But feel free to stand on the un-famous twin's bed
 
242
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,507
还能照张相
And take a picture.

244
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,415
这和我想象的别无二致
It's exactly how I imagined it.
 
245
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:55,487
当代的都市公主啊
Urban princess contemporary.
 
246
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,725
花多少钱能让我过了这条鹅绒围栏
How much to get me past the velvet rope?
 
247
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,762
抱歉  亚蒂
Sorry, Artie.
 
248
00:11:03,764 --> 00:11:04,896
这是禁止入内的
That is off-limits.
 
249
00:11:04,898 --> 00:11:06,364
10 美元
10 bucks.
 
250
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,200
能让我享受一下明星风范的话给你 20 美元
I'll give you 20 if I can have a diva moment.

252
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:12,604
成交
Deal.
 
253
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,305
我很想开开眼
I really want to see this.
 
254
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,614
你确定这是个好主意么
Are you sure this is a good idea?
 
255
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:25,383
帕克  我认为这一切都不是个好主意
Parker, I'm not sure any of this is a good idea.
 
256
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,522
预备
Ready?

258
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,903
丽芙与亚蒂要白头偕老
Liv and artie forever! 
 
259
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:47,739
我实在是太想取笑一下了
I really want to make fun of that.
 
260
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:50,975
但是那确实是才气不浅啊
But it was nothing short of magnificent.
