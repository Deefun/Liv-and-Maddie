262
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,383
我们已经努力了三个小时了
We have been at this for three hours.
 
263
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,485
搅拌奶油到底要多长时间啊
How long does it take to churn butter?
 
264
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:02,487
很明显至少要花三个小时
Well, obviously it takes at least three hours!
 
265
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:06,758
我很抱歉  布丽  我只是

You-- you saw that, right?
 
272
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:31,282
我们还能够记上分么
We're still going to get credit for that?
 
273
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:33,451
不能
No.
 
274
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:37,322

太好了
Yes!
 
277
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:46,498
伐木的秘诀就是痛恨那块木头
The secret is to really hate the wood.
 
278
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:50,034
妈

281
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,774
都已经拿定那个金搅子了
We've got that golden butter churn all locked up.
 
282
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,542
但是  除非我们干了什么傻事
Well, unless we do something dumb--
 
283
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:59,577
我说的我们  是指你  所以最好什么都别碰
And by we, I mean you-- so don't touch anything.
 
284
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,847

288
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:13,691
你是不是刚刚喝了一口又绵又滑的白水
Did you just take a nice, long drink of water
 
289
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,893
来防止脱水呢
To avoid dehydration?
 
290
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:17,061
对的 夫人
Yes, ma'am.
 
291
00:13:17,063 --> 00:13:18,563
那么你就死掉啦
Then you're dead.

呃 什么 这
Uh-- wha-- uh...
 
293
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,403
等一下 先别
Wait, hold on.
 
294
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,504
我煮沸了这水啊
I boiled this water.
 
295
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:29,007
不不不不  你煮的是那桶水

把死人抬出去
Bringing out the dead!
 
299
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,519
这  不  妈妈  我都是很小心的
Wha-- no, mom, I have been so careful.
 
300
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,555
你懂得  我们那么领先
You know what-- we are so far ahead,
 
301
00:13:43,557 --> 00:13:46,691
你单枪匹马就能把金搅子赢回来
You win that golden butter churn for both of us!
 
302
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,092

把尸体准备展览吧
Let's prepare the body for the viewing.
