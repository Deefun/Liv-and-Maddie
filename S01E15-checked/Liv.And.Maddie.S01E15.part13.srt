423
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,412
当我放声高唱
if I sing about leeches
 
424
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:10,148
蚂蟥就会自行退散
maybe they'll go away, la la la 
 
425
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,416
啦啦啦啦啦啦蚂蟥退散了
la la la la la la leeches! 
 
426
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:18,823
快走掉啊  蚂蟥们
Get off me, leeches.
 
427
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:23,194
我刚看见布丽顺着大路一边叫一边跑我就知道你出事了
I just saw Bree running and screaming down the trail.
 
428
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,664
呃  我不明白你为何会这么想
Well, I can't imagine why you would think that.
 
429
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:28,332
我简直是好的不得了啊
I have never been better.
 
430
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,168
我被蚂蝗叮上了  妈  我腿上都是蚂蟥
I have leeches, mom. i've got the leeches.
 
431
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:33,404
哦  对  你确实腿上都是蚂蟥
Oh, yes, you have leeches.
 
432
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,139
但是  你很幸运
Well, lucky for you,
 
433
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:37,441
每个好妈妈都会随身携带信用卡
Every good mom keeps a credit card handy
 
434
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,243
来预防紧急情况
In case of an emergency.
 
435
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,014
呃
Ugh.
 
436
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:45,950
这是另一个喜爱信用卡的理由啊
Yet another reason to love credit cards.

439
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,457
当年的女性是不会有信用卡的
Pioneer women did not carry credit cards.
 
440
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,029
你被取消资格了
You are disqualified.
 
441
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,299
请交出你的软帽吧
Please surrender your bonnet.
 
442
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,367
哦  不  妈妈
Oh, no, mom!
 
443
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,469
你的软帽发型太可怕了
You have horrible bonnet-head.
 
444
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,207
她说的没错
Oh, she's not wrong.
 
445
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:10,841
你看起来跟头野牛似的
You look like a bison.
 
446
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:15,379
那么 丽芙
Well, liv,
 
447
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,015
你是鲁尼家最后一个还在坚持的了
You are the last Rooney standing.
 
448
00:20:18,017 --> 00:20:19,717
我对你骄傲极了
I couldn't be prouder of you.
 
449
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,419
你是我们中把金搅子
You're our last chance
 
450
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:23,254
带回家的最后希望了
To bring home the golden butter churn.
 
451
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:27,191
我才不在乎什么破金搅子呢
I don't care about some stupid golden butter churn.
 
452
00:20:27,193 --> 00:20:29,327
我只是想和我的妈妈多呆呆
I just wanted to spend time with my mom.
 
453
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,395
哦 谢谢了
Oh, thank you.
 
454
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,897
你口中的妈妈指的是我  对吧
You are talking about me, right?

456
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,801
我想我只是有点嫉妒
I guess I just got a little bit jealous
 
457
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,302
你和玛蒂的母女时刻罢了
With all of you and maddie's mother-daughter time,
 
458
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,171
我也想拥有一些
And I just wanted some for me.
 
459
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:44,141
顺带一提  我可从没玛蒂的腿上刮过蚂蟥
I never scraped leeches off of maddie's legs.

461
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,812
谢谢你照顾我
Thanks for taking care of me.
 
462
00:20:47,814 --> 00:20:50,514
你才是个实打实的好妈妈
You are one butt bomb of mom.

464
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,753
我终于把这老娘的架子给夺回来了
Mama got her butt bomb back.
 
465
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:58,122
砰 搭好了
Boom! dropped.
