201
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:32,577
抱歉我来晚了
Oh, my late arrivals.
 
202
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,413
欢迎来到地球上最美妙的地方
Welcome to the best place on earth--
 
203
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,448
昔日
The past.
 
204
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:41,553
上缴你们所有现代物品的时间到了
Time to turn in all modern-day devices.
 
205
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,089
噢  妈呀
Oh, dear.
 
206
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:46,758
呃...
Um...
 
207
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:52,230
你所说的“现代”到底是什么意思呢
So exactly how like "modern" are we talking?
 
208
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:54,466
因为我的手机已经挺老了
'cause, I mean, my phone's pretty old.
 
209
00:08:54,468 --> 00:08:57,536
我想我大概是六个月前买的吧
I think i've had it for at least like six months.
 
210
00:08:57,538 --> 00:09:00,305
可是拓荒者们没有手机  你也不能有
Well, if the pioneers didn't have it, neither can you.

212
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:09,447
哦对了  别忘了上缴你们的梳子
Oh, and don't forget your hairbrushes.

214
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,386
我们是拓荒者  又不是动物
We're pioneers, not animals.
 
215
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:18,189
开疆时代的妇女们会自己削多余的柴禾
On the frontier women would whittle hair-grooming tools
 
216
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,125
来制造梳头工具
Made out of leftover firewood.
 
217
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,427
梳子拿好不谢
Here's a comb.
 
218
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:28,700
我的宝贝们啊
My babies.
 
219
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:31,670
别担心  亲爱的
Don't worry, sugar.
 
220
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:33,772
每个人都是有值钱玩意的
Everyone has their price.
 
221
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:36,107
嘿 我用“老妈架子圣诞节”的签名照
How about I trade you that curling iron
 
222
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,376
换你的卷发棒怎么样
For a signed copy of "a very butt bomb christmas"?
 
223
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:43,448
哦 丽芙 我们要谈谈
Oh, liv, honey. we should talk.
 
224
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,351
我开始怀疑你是不是因为我没邀请你而不高兴了
I'm starting to wonder if you're upset that I didn't invite you.

226
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:50,388
你怎么可能会这么想呢
Why ever would you think that?
 
227
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:52,557
你从国家的另外一边
You brought in a substitute mom
 
228
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,559
带来了个冒牌妈妈
From the other side of the country.
 
229
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,827
这不是个明显的信号么
It's kind of a red flag.
 
230
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:58,597
哦  也许你是对的  妈妈
Oh, yeah, maybe you're right, mom.
 
231
00:09:58,599 --> 00:10:00,465
也许我确实有点不高兴
Maybe I am a little bit upset.
 
232
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:04,402
也许我现在要在你的比赛里打败你了
Maybe now I will beat you at your own game.
 
233
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,238
引用拓荒者们的话就是
As the pioneers would say,
 
234
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,673
愿君祥瑞
I bid you good day.

236
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:18,350
这改变不了什么
This changes nothing!
