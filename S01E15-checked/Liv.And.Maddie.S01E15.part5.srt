132
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:14,313
那么现在麦蒂去剥树皮吃了
So while maddie's off skinning lunch...
 
133
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,350
我们干嘛不来叙叙旧呢
Why don't we catch up?
 
134
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:21,186
布丽  你不跟我说一下就来
Bree, it is so good of you to come
 
135
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:23,188
协助丽芙真是太好了
And support Liv on such short notice.
 
136
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,890
好的  凯伦
Well, karen,
 
137
00:05:24,892 --> 00:05:26,325
当我的电视里的女儿打来电话
When my tv daughter called,
 
138
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,327
我就立马放下手头的一切赶来了
I just canceled everything on my schedule to be here.

140
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:31,029
也就是那些值得我
Just one of those situations
 
141
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:33,298
搭个做老娘的架子的事
Where I had to drop a butt bomb of mom on it.
 
142
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,402
搭个做老娘的架子
"drop a butt bomb of mom on it"
 
143
00:05:37,404 --> 00:05:39,338
曾经是我的口头禅
Is something I used to say.
 
144
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,175
布丽听见了  结果就给她的电视角色抢去了
Bree heard it and turned it into her tv character's catchphrase.
 
145
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:45,344
自从那时  她就靠这发大财了
Since then, she's made a fortune
 
146
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,579
给烹饪书搭了个做老娘的架子
Dropping a butt bomb of mom on cookbooks,
 
147
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:50,582
锻炼视频  和让你青春永驻的酸奶
Workout videos, and yogurt that keeps you young.
 
148
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,118
我就此没有用过这句话
I haven't said it since.
 
149
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,454
好怀念啊
I really miss the butt bomb.
 
150
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:56,888
那么  妈妈
Well, mom--
 
151
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,923
- 咋了  亲爱的  - 啥事  甜心
- yeah, sugar? - what, sweetie?
 
152
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,624
噢...
Oh...
 
153
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,260
噢  天啊
Oh, wow!
 
154
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,629
这还真是尴尬啊  对不
This is awkward, isn't it?

156
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,167
我怎么没想到呢  呵呵
Hadn't really thought of that. ha ha!
 
157
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,371
之后我们要去搭帐篷
So we should probably go set up our tent.
 
158
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,341
然后我们在篝火边上见吧  凯伦女士
And I'll see you around the campfire, Karen?
